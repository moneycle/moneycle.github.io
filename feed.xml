        <title>Super-Simple Virtual-Buffer Withdrawal Strategy - Revisited</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently re-reading the original article that presented the concept of
this simple withdrawal strategy and found the explanation to be overly complex
which seems wrong for something that’s supposed to be simple.
So I ask you, dear reader, for another chance to describe the strategy in a way
that is more approachable (with less math) to the average reader.
In fact, the most complex thing about the strategy is the name&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-simplest-version&quot;&gt;The Simplest Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In it’s simplest form, the strategy boils down to the following 2 equations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;initial_monthly_withdrawal = portfolio_value / 400
next_monthly_withdrawal    =
     ⅔ * current_withdrawal + ⅓ * current_portfolio_value / 400
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first equation tells you how much you can withdrawal monthly from
your portfolio in the first year that you start taking withdrawals.
Dividing your portfolio value by 400 is equivalent to taking a 3% annual
withdrawal and gets the process started.  Conversely, if you multiply your monthly
expenses by 400, that can give you an approximation of how big your portfolio needs
to be in order to retire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second equation tells you how much you should adjust your withdrawal amount
each year.  This particular version of the equation assumes a buffer-size of 3
years and 3% withdrawal rate.  In case you haven’t been reading other
articles on this site, the buffer is what provides ballast to the withdrawal
equation so that your withdrawal amounts aren’t whipped around too much by a
volatile investment portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s it!&lt;/strong&gt;  If you’re comfortable with the assumed withdrawal rate of 3%
and buffer of 3 years then you can stop reading and just follow the above
equations (which I use for my own situation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-900000-portfolio&quot;&gt;Example: $900,000 portfolio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a simple example, start with a portfolio worth $900k.  Dividing
a this by 400 gives the initial monthly withdrawal of,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;initial_monthly_withdrawal = $900000 / 400
                           = $2250/month
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piece of cake.  It’s up to you if you actually save the full 3-years of that
withdrawal amount into a safe place.  I recommend you at least save 1 year’s
worth, $27k in this example, in a safe account such as an interest-bearing savings.
Or maybe you’d feel better putting the entire 3-year buffer, $81k, in savings,
that’s fine too.  It mostly depends on your risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, after one year, you re-evaluate the portfolio to decide whether to increase
or decrease your withdrawal amount.  Let’s say portfolio has had a good year, and is
worth $990k at the end of the year.  Your next year’s withdrawal rate
is computed as,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;next_monthly_withdrawal = ⅔ * 2250 + ⅓ * 990000 / 400
                        = 1500 + 825
                        = $2325/month
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though the portfolio grew by 10%, you only increase the monthly withdrawal
amount by 3.33% (because of the buffering).  It works both way, if the market has
a particularly bad year, it won’t kill your monthly withdrawal income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every year after the first year, you just use the 2nd equation to determine
the withdrawal amount for the following year.  Over
the long haul, with these equations, your withdrawal amount will hover around 3%
of your total portfolio value&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-general-version&quot;&gt;The General Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer a little more control over the withdrawal rate and buffer size,
then here’s the more general equations for this strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;initial_monthly_withdrawal =
     portfolio_value * withdrawal_rate / 12
next_monthly_withdrawal    =
     (1-1/buffer_size) * current_withdrawal +
       (1/buffer_size) * portfolio_value * withdrawal_rate / 12
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you prefer a more aggressive 4% withdrawal that is stabilized
by a larger 5-year buffer then the withdrawal equations would simplify to,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;initial_monthly_withdrawal = portfolio_value / 300
next_monthly_withdrawal    =
     ⅘ * current_withdrawal + ⅕ * current_portfolio_value / 300
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;easy-peasy&quot;&gt;Easy Peasy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all there is to implementing the Super-Simple Virtual-Buffer Withdrawal Strategy.
If you want to see the math behind the strategy, refer to the overly-complex
&lt;a href=&quot;/super-simple-virtual-buffer-withdrawal-strategy/&quot;&gt;original article&lt;/a&gt;.
The main takeaway from this strategy is that you only need to know two data
points each year, (1) the current withdrawal amount and (2) the current
portfolio value.
With those two numbers, you can calculate the next year’s withdrawal amount in
a way that is simple to compute but still buffers your retirement income against
wild fluctuations in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m open to suggestions on better names for the strategy &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Technically if the market steadily increases over the long term your withdrawal amount would probably lag slightly below 3% on average, but who’s counting? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>To Roth or Not to Roth? - Part 2, Reframing the Question</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many articles are written about the virtues of the Roth account&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
or the Traditional account types, but it’s rare to find an article suggesting
why you should probably consider having both types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I try to show that both types have their place, but the
important thing is to understand the main concept that will help you to determine
how much of each type you should have.  In short, the thesis of this
article is that you should first determine the maximum amount to
contribute to your Traditional account, then you should allocate the remainder
of your qualified savings to your Roth account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basics---tax-efficiency&quot;&gt;Basics - Tax Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core decision of choosing Roth vs Traditional comes down to your tax rate
now (when you save the funds) versus your tax rate in the future (when you
withdraw the funds).  If your tax rates are identical now
and in the future you should choose the Roth because it has more flexibility
(access to principal, no distribution requirements).
But if your tax rates in the future, at the time of withdrawal, are lower than
your current marginal tax rate, then you could save money by deferring those
taxes into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a good saver, then there’s a pretty good chance that you should
be using both Roth and Traditional.  Why?  Because there’s a very real
possibility that your Traditional savings will outgrow the lower tax brackets,
especially when you consider other future income sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;filling-future-tax-brackets&quot;&gt;Filling Future Tax Brackets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about your tax brackets over time.  For example, in an over-simplified
view of the world (ignoring inflation and other adjustments), your tax brackets
might look like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not_2-brackets.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tax Brackets Over Time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted this is a naive view of tax brackets (they actually do change over time),
but I’m just trying to make a point so ignore those details for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general idea of saving to a Traditional account is that in the future you
will take those withdrawals out in lower tax brackets.  I like to visualize this
as pouring those Traditional IRA funds into the lower tax brackets over the time
that spans all of your retirement years.
For example, the following picture shows IRA funds filling up the 0% tax bracket
from retirement forward, which would be appropriate for anybody in a tax bracket
above 0% (probably everybody reading this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not_2-filling_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Filling 0% Tax Bracket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the above picture can be extended to higher tax brackets.  For example,
if you’re in the 33% tax bracket now, any savings you put into a Traditional IRA
now could save you money in the future if they were poured into any tax
bracket below 33% over the course of your retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking that the growth on the assets matter, but for this decision
it really doesn’t.  That’s because taking a percentage out now and letting your
investment grow (Roth) is mathematically equivalent to letting your entire
investment grow and taking the same percentage out later (Traditional).  So it
just comes down to figuring out when the tax rates will be lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick then is to figure out how big your Traditional account savings bucket
can get before it starts to leak into your current tax bracket in the future.
Because if you’re going to fill in your future tax brackets at your current
(or higher) rates, then you might as well contribute to a Roth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;upper-bounds-for-traditional-accounts&quot;&gt;Upper Bounds for Traditional Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of determining what &lt;em&gt;percentage&lt;/em&gt; to put in a Roth, the problem
becomes one of figuring out the maximum &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; amount to put into a
Traditional account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can approach this problem by putting an upper bound on the size of
the Traditional IRA bucket (in the picture).  Once you know what that
upper bound is, you can
project the maximum that your Traditional contributions should be in order
to fill that bucket by your retirement date.
The projection will never be an exact number because returns are unpredictable
and retirement dates change.  But if you have this framework in place,
then you can make minor adjustments every year to account for the shifts in
your portfolio balance and retirement date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-income-sources&quot;&gt;Other Income Sources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the hardest variables to predict ahead of time is the amount
of money you might get from other income sources.  Social Security is one
source that is fairly predictable, but what about income interest, dividends,
side-job income, pensions, inherited IRAs, annuities, et cetera.
You may have a good handle on what those sources are now, but it’s
not always easy to predict all future income sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not_2-other_income.png&quot; alt=&quot;Filling 0% Tax Bracket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of future income sources is that they fill in your lower tax
brackets &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; withdrawals from your Traditional accounts.  This means
that you might have less room to withdraw funds in those lower tax brackets
in the future.  So the more future income you have from other sources, the
less you should contribute to Traditional accounts now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;realistic-tax-brackets&quot;&gt;Realistic Tax Brackets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the maximum Traditional contributions, we also should consider
a more realistic view of tax brackets in retirement.  If you’ve read previous
articles on this blog you may be familiar with the effects of taxes of a couple
life situations.  There are 3 general bands that can effect tax brackets as
show below.  The picture below does not represent every situation but is meant
to suggest how complicated it can get (your situation will be different).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not_2-3_bands.png&quot; alt=&quot;3 Tax-Bracket Bands&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are getting health care from the ACA before age 65 then you would fall
into the band I’m calling the “ACA years”.
Those people eligible to receive Affordable Care Act premium credits may see
their &lt;a href=&quot;/affordable-care-act-may-increase-your-marginal-tax-rate/&quot;&gt;tax brackets jumbled up&lt;/a&gt;
by those credits before they start taking medicare at age 65.
And this situation could very well change by the time you read this given
the current political climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second band, which I call the “early medicare years”, is the time before
age 70 and after age 65.  This band has a fairly “normal” tax bracket signature
because it is not affected by ACA or Social Security effects on taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking social security can effect the tax brackets at the lower end of the
income spectrum.  As discussed in a &lt;a href=&quot;/how-social-security-messes-with-your-tax-brackets/&quot;&gt;previous article on this blog&lt;/a&gt;
these effects can have significant impacts to tax brackets at or below 25%.
Also, since most people should probably delay taking social security until age
70 (your situation may vary), we will consider the case of retiring at age 70
while taking social security in the next article in this series in this band
which I call the “Social Security years”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coming-next&quot;&gt;Coming Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next articles in this series will attempt to address the different bands of
time and how they might inform how much to save in Traditional accounts.
Ultimately the goal is to give you the tools (and maybe a calculator) to
estimate how much to contribute to Traditional accounts every year going
forward until you exit the rat race.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Social Security Messes With Your Tax Brackets</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While Social Security provides a nice base-level of income for many retirees,
it can have some interesting effects on the tax brackets.  The basic
philosophy of Social Security taxation is that you won’t be taxed on Social
Security benefits if you have no other income sources.  But as your other income
sources grow, your Social Security benefits may be subject to taxation.  This is
really just a means test that allows Uncle Sam to increase your
taxable income if you are well off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting into the weeds for a minute, the rules for taxation of Social Security
are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, calculate what’s called the “provisional income” by adding half of
  your social security income to your “other income”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Other income” is my term, but it represents your taxable income (AGI) plus
  your non-taxable interest income.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your “provisional income” is above the first threshold ($25,000 single,
$32,000 married), then 50% of the amount above that threshold is
added to your taxable income.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your “provisional income” is above the second threshold ($34,000 single,
$44,000 married), then an additional 35% of the amount above the second
threshold is added to your taxable income, for a total of 85%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A maximum of 85% of your Social Security benefit may be taxed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net effect of these rules is that, as your “other income” rises, then your
tax rate can rise proportionally.  So while the IRS frames it as a taxation on
your Social Security benefits, it’s mathematially equivalent to an increase
in your marginal tax rate.  For example, if you are married and your provisional
income is above $44,000, then your tax rate may be 85% higher than you think it
is because 85% more of your total income will be taxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-math-nerds-click-to-showhidejavascriptvoid0classtoggle-onclicktogglemath&quot;&gt;For Math Nerds &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:void(0);&quot; class=&quot;toggle&quot; onclick=&quot;toggle(&#39;#math&#39;)&quot;&gt;click to show/hide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;math&quot; class=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The graph in the previous section was generated by calculating the taxable income
and applying that to the income tax brackets to figure out the actual marginal
tax rates.  Here is the math that is used to calculate the taxable income.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, provisional income is defined as half of social security
income plus “other” income,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;income_prov = income_ss/2 + income_other
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Half of the provisional income above the first threshold (single = $25k,
married = $32k) is taxable,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;income_taxable = income_other +
                 max(0, 0.5(income_prov - threshold_1))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; constraint makes sure anything below the threshold is not subtracted
from &lt;code&gt;income_other&lt;/code&gt;.  Likewise, adding in the second threshold (single = $34k,
married = $44k), 35% of income above that threshold is added to the 50% above the
first threshold (for a total of 85% above both thresholds),&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;income_taxable = income_other +
                 max(0, 0.50(income_prov - threshold_1)) +
                 max(0, 0.35(income_prov - threshold_2))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But we also need to add in the constraint that no more than 85% of social security
is taxed.  This gives us a unified equation to calculate taxable income,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;income_taxable = income_other +
                 min(0.85*income_ss,
                     max(0, 0.50(income_prov - threshold_1)) +
                     max(0, 0.35(income_prov - threshold_2)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interactive-plot&quot;&gt;Interactive Plot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all pretty abstract so let’s plot what the tax brackets looks like
versus income levels for a married couple in 2017 with social security income of
&lt;span class=&quot;ss-income&quot;&gt;$50,000&lt;/span&gt;.  Move the social income slider below
the graph to see how it affects the tax brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;observations&quot;&gt;Observations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you move the Social Security income slider, you may notice the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Security = $0&lt;/strong&gt; - with no Social Security, your tax brackets are
  just the normal stair-step brackets that we are all used to hearing about.
  The larger your income, the more your marginal tax rate is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS &amp;gt; $8,000&lt;/strong&gt; a “new” tax bracket of 27.75% appears and gets wider as your
  income increases.  This is due to the 15% tax bracket being increased by 85%
  as your provisional income goes above the 2nd threshold.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS ≈ $17,000&lt;/strong&gt; at approximately $17,000 the 10% tax bracket effectively
  disappears!  That is due to the fact that 10% bracket is increased by 50% to 15%
  because your provisional income is between the 1st and 2nd thresholds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS ≈ $47,000&lt;/strong&gt; a crazy new 46.25% tax bracket appears and represents the
  25% tax bracket being increased by 85%.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS ≈ $53,000&lt;/strong&gt; the 15% tax bracket becomes extinct if you are lucky enough
  to get this much Social Security income (for a married couple).  In other words,
  beyond the tax-free zone of deductions and exemptions, the first tax bracket
  you hit will actually be an 18.5% tax bracket (10% increased by 85%).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing income reduces the size of the tax-free zone.  The tax-free zone
  represents the standard deduction and personal exemptions.  This is effectively
  decreased because it is absorbed in the taxable portion of the social security
  income.  So even though it’s not technically decreased, mathematically the
  amount of untaxed income above and beyond Social Security decreases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of Social Security taxation can significantly impact how you save
for retirement and affects the Roth vs Traditional account tradeoff.
That’s why I decided to write this article before writing Part 2 of the
&lt;a href=&quot;/to-roth-or-not-to-roth-part-1/&quot;&gt;Roth or Not to Roth&lt;/a&gt; series.
The basic implication is that your future tax rate not be what you think it will
be (even without changes to the current tax code).
Given that your tax rate could very well be higher than you think, this could
push you to use a Roth account more often than you do currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not a single solution for all cases, but let’s break it down a little
for different levels of Social Security income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS = $17,000&lt;/strong&gt;, at this level you still have $23,300 of untaxed “other”
  income beyond
  SS so you would ideally like to defer income that fills that tax-free zone.  But above
  this, your first tax bracket is effectively 15%.  If your current tax bracket
  is 15%, you might want to consider saving to a Roth account at the point you think
  your Traditional accounts will generate $23,300 of income.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS = $47,000&lt;/strong&gt;, for this higher level you still have $18,367 of untaxed
  “other” income to play with.
  Beyond that tax rates increase pretty quickly into the 18.5% and
  27.75% brackets.  If you’re in the 15% tax bracket now, you should consider
  using Roth accounts to the extent that your future other income sources are
  above $20,000.
  If you’re in the 25% tax bracket you should consider using Roth accounts to
  the extent that your future other income sources are above $28,000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SS = $53,000&lt;/strong&gt;, as your SS benefit increases to this higher level,
  the amount of “other” income is tax-free down to about $17,000.
  Above that your lowest tax rate is above 18.5%, so if you are currently in
  the 15% bracket, the Roth option is best beyond the point where you have
  $17,000 of other income.  If you’re currently in the 25% tax bracket,
  consider using Roth when your future income from taxable sources goes above $27,000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you retire early (before taking any SS), then your tax brackets won’t
  be affected until you start taking SS.  So plan on using the existing unaltered
  tax brackets for your tax planning in the time before you start taking
  Social Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general upshot of all of this is that, if you are not using
Roth accounts for retirement savings, you might want to take another look at that
decision in light of how your Social Security benefits affect your future tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>To Roth or Not to Roth? - Part 1, The Ideal World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most often when you see an article discussing whether to choose a Roth
over a Traditional option (401k/403b/IRA), the decision is stated as a comparison
between current and future tax rates.  While that’s mostly correct advice,
it fails to recognize that future withdrawals tend to occur across &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt;
tax brackets while current contributions tend to be in a single tax bracket.
I first became aware of the concept of filling in lower tax brackets from an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://thefinancebuff.com/case-against-roth-401k.html&quot;&gt;excellent piece written by The Finance Buff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first of two articles, I take a look at an ideal-world example that
explores the concept of how much should go towards a Roth versus a Traditional
option.  In the second article, I will take a look at some more real-world
cases that should give more concrete advice on how to determine how much to
contribute to each option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basics-of-roth-vs-traditional&quot;&gt;Basics of Roth vs Traditional&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s discuss the basic differences between the Roth and Traditional
options.  The most important difference between the two options is &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; you are taxed.
Roth options are taxed now in that you fund them with after-tax dollars and you are not
taxed again when you withdrawal the funds.  Traditional options
are taxed later, so you deduct your contributions from your taxes now and pay
income taxes later when you make withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to maximize how much money you keep, the basic tradeoff becomes
one of shifting the taxes to the point in time when you have the lower tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the tax rates are equal now and in the future, then mathematically the amount
you end up with is identical after the taxes are accounted for.  However, in this
case I recommend using the Roth option primarily because the Roth has fewer
requirements on the distribution of funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tradeoff&quot;&gt;The Tradeoff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding how much money to allocate to a Roth, the basic goal is to allocate
funds to the Roth that will be taxed at the same rate or higher in
the future.  Conversely, all funds that will fall into lower tax brackets in the
future should be allocated to the Traditional option now.
This last part is where most people fail to consider the whole picture.
Just because you may be in the same or even higher tax brackets
in the future does NOT mean that some of the funds won’t be taxed at a lower rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;filling-up-the-tax-brackets&quot;&gt;Filling Up The Tax Brackets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make a contribution to a Traditional IRA/401k/403b today,
in most cases all of that contribution will be in your current income tax bracket.
Sometimes you might also cross over to the next lower tax-bracket when making a
contribution if you are near a tax boundary when you begin your contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the future, when you start making withdrawals from your Traditional IRA,
your withdrawals start filling in the tax brackets from the bottom up.
I like to visualize this as pouring money into the income “funnel” as depicted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  .center {
    text-align: center;
  }
  .funnel {
    float: left;
    margin: 0.4em 1.5em 0.8em 0em;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not-funnel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Money Funnel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, for a married couple filing jointly, the personal exemption plus standard
deduction is $20,700 so that amount is taxed at 0% (which I think of as the 0% tax
bracket).  Then the 10% bracket swallows up the next $18,550 of income, and the
15% bracket gets the next $56,750, and so on.  I have made the tax brackets to
appear as funnel-shaped because the brackets get bigger as income increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, most people will have other sources of income filling in the lower
tax brackets, and we will consider that case too.
But the key point is that future withdrawals fill in tax
brackets from the bottom up before reaching today’s marginal tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the goal of an investor should be to &lt;strong&gt;plan for today’s Traditional
contributions to fill up tomorrow’s lower tax brackets&lt;/strong&gt;, then
&lt;strong&gt;invest the remainder in the Roth option&lt;/strong&gt;.
That sounds easy on the surface, but the hard part is figuring out how
to translate that statement into actionable numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saving-within-a-single-tax-bracket&quot;&gt;Saving within a Single Tax Bracket&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;funnel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not-120-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;Earn 120, Save 16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by looking at a typical example where somebody has all of their
savings occur within a single marginal tax bracket.
Consider a married couple named Jon &amp;amp; Sally that makes a total income of $120,000
and saves a total of $16,000 to their retirement plans.  If that money
is saved in a Traditional retirement plan then they would have a
gross income (AGI) of $104,000.
With the standard deduction, the low-end of the 25% tax bracket occurs at $96,000
of gross income so the $104,000 puts them $8,000 above the lower threshold of
the 25% tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s further assume that they are saving all they can afford to and that the
$104,000 of income represents their current AND future day-to-day expenses.  This is
a bit of a stretch, but I would argue that most people’s spending habits don’t
change all that much when they transition into retirement.  You will probably be
spending more in some areas in less in others but basically your spending
profile won’t change by a drastic amount in retirement.
Mostly I’m just trying to get a baseline equation, so stick with me for now.
If that $104,000 of income represents what they need in the future (albeit in
today’s dollars),
that suggests that in the future their “livable income” would be roughly $8000
into the 25% tax bracket.  In the extreme case where this couple has no other sources of
retirement income, that would mean they would need about 96k/104k (92%) of their
withdrawals to occur in tax brackets below 25% and the remaining 8k/104k (8%)
would come out in the 25% tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you knew that your future funds would come out in the same tax bracket, then
those funds might as well go into a Roth account today.  So in this example,
the couple could contribute 8% to their Roth.  Mathematically,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = (livable_income - tax_threshold) / livable_income
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assigning variables,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;L = livable_income = current_income - max_savings
T = tax_threshold
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = (L - T) / L
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-income-sources&quot;&gt;Other Income sources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one assumption that is hard to ignore is that the couple has no other
income sources in retirement.  But almost everybody has at least one other
source of income such as Social Security or pensions, and many people will
have multiple sources of income.  So let’s adjust the math to account for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;funnel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not-120-16-36.png&quot; alt=&quot;Earn 120, Save 16, Base 36&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Jon &amp;amp; Sally expect to receive other income in the form of social security
that will total $36,000/year in today’s dollars, then their savings don’t have
to provide the full $104,000 of income.  Their savings only have to fill the
funnel up between $36,000 and $104,000, which is a difference of $68,000.
So when they convert their nest egg to future
income, 8k/68k or about 12% of that future income is in the same tax bracket
they are saving in today.  That suggests that they
could save 12% today in a Roth because it would likely be in the same tax
bracket if deferred to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modifying the first equation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = (L - T) / (L - B)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;B = base income from &quot;other&quot; sources (in today&#39;s dollars)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing what your future base income from “other” sources can be a difficult
thing to figure out.  But if you’re only expecting Social Security, I suggest
you start off with about 40% of your current income.  This is a &lt;strong&gt;very rough&lt;/strong&gt;
estimate based on the idea that, on average, people receive around 40% of their
income back in social security.  But you really should take a look at your
actual social security (or equivalent) statements to get an idea of how much
you’ll really get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At what point does 100% of your total savings go towards a Roth?  Mathematically,
if &lt;code&gt;(L-T) &amp;gt; (L-B)&lt;/code&gt; the equation goes above 100%.  This simplifies to the
comparison of &lt;code&gt;B &amp;gt; T&lt;/code&gt;.  So you should contribute everything to Roth when your
“base income” sources equal or exceed
your current lower tax threshold.  That makes sense because it means that
if you know that you will be at or above the current tax rate in the future
you might as well contribute everything to Roth today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just modify the equation slightly to account for this scenario,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = min((L - T) / (L - B), 100%)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saving-across-multiple-tax-brackets&quot;&gt;Saving Across Multiple Tax Brackets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;funnel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not-120-30-36.png&quot; alt=&quot;Earn 120, Save 30, Base 36&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s consider the case where Jon &amp;amp; Sally, are able to save enough to cross
over into a lower tax bracket if the entire savings were deductible.  So consider
with the same $120,000 of income and a savings rate of $30,000 per year.
This suggests that they are able to live comfortably off of the remaining $90,000
of income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the bottom of the 25% tax bracket is at $96,000, Jon &amp;amp; Sally would then
be descending into the 15% marginal tax bracket.  Since we’re assuming that
the $90,000 of income represents their future income needs and $90,000 of income
would be marginally taxed at 15%, everything they save in the 25% tax bracket
should simply go to the Traditional savings option.  Then they would apply the
equation from earlier but only to the portion in the 15% tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first $24,000 of savings goes into Traditional.  The remaining $6000 of
savings would follow the previous equation, &lt;code&gt;(90000-39250)/(90000-36000)&lt;/code&gt; or
94% of $6000, that goes to Roth.  Notice that I’m using $39,250 as the low end
of the tax bracket because that’s where the 15% tax bracket bottoms out (for a
married couple using standard deductions).  Finishing the
math for this example, 94% of $6000 is &lt;code&gt;0.94*6000/30000&lt;/code&gt; or about 19% of the
overall savings that goes to Roth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, we can express the overall equation
for the dual-tax bracket case like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = everything in lowest tax bracket * previous equation
                = min((T1-L) / S, 100%) * min((L - T0) / (L - B), 100%)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;S = total amount saved
L = livable_income
T0 = tax bracket threshold below L
T1 = tax bracket threshold above L
B = future base income
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a plot of what Roth percentage looks like versus income levels
for a married couple&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in 2016 with a savings rate of
&lt;span class=&quot;savings-rate&quot;&gt;12%&lt;/span&gt; and a future
base income equal to &lt;span class=&quot;base-percent&quot;&gt;40%&lt;/span&gt; of their current income
(move sliders below the graph to change percentages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;insights&quot;&gt;Insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the plot of Roth percent versus income and playing with the sliders gives
a few of insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Roth savings rate drops off rapidly right above each tax bracket.  This is due
  to the fact that your savings at those income levels can quickly push
  you into a lower tax bracket.   So if you save enough to cross over into
  a lower tax bracket, all of the savings in the
  higher tax brackets would tend to go towards the Traditional option, while
  most of the savings that cross-over into lower tax brackets would go towards
  the Roth option.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Roth savings rates tend to peak just below the tax bracket boundaries.
  That’s because you are as far away as you can be from the lower edge of the
  tax bracket which means that a higher percentage of your retirement income
  is likely to be in the same tax bracket (or higher) as you are in now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increases to future income pushes the entire curve up.  This means that the more
  you expect to earn from other sources such as social security and pensions,
  the closer your retirement tax bracket will be to your current tax bracket
  so you would tend to want to save more to a Roth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-you-assume-you-make-me-read-part-2&quot;&gt;When You Assume, You Make Me Read Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this analysis is interesting and moving the sliders around is fun, there
are many assumptions that make it not particularly useful.  Here are some of
the more egregious assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The model assumes that the investor will retire exactly when they have enough
  to retire without considering the probability that most people will either have
  too little or too much at the time of retirement.  Assuming you work a little
  past the point of being financially independent, then you would probably want to
  allocate a little more to the Roth option because the extra savings in the
  Traditional option would fill up the lower tax brackets in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Returns on the invested funds and inflation were both ignored.  If your
  investments beat inflation then the amount you have at retirement
  to fill in lower tax brackets would be larger.
  This also suggests allocating more funds to Roths.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employer matches were completely ignored.  Since those matching funds would
  normally be in before-tax dollars, this would tend to suggest higher allocations
  towards the Roth option than shown in this analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Part 2 I’m going to change the perspective of the analysis from mostly theoretical
to be a bit more practical.  Also, instead of focusing how much to put
in a &lt;strong&gt;Roth&lt;/strong&gt;, I will change the perspective slightly to examine how much total
money you should save in your &lt;strong&gt;Traditional&lt;/strong&gt; savings option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the plot, I capped the qualified contribution at $48,000 because each person in a couple over 50 can contribute a max of $24,000 to qualified accounts. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Radioactive Half-Life of Expenses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the world of science, the term “half-life” is used to describe &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life&quot;&gt;“the time required
for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value”&lt;/a&gt;.
One common application of this concept is for radioactive decay and the half-life
is a useful measure in science to characterize how quickly something will decay over
time.  Probably the most common application of this concept is used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating&quot;&gt;carbon dating&lt;/a&gt; which allows scientists
to fairly accurately estimate the age of objects containing radiocarbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that portfolio expenses can have a similar effect as radioactive
decay.  Namely, the higher the expense, the faster your portfolio will reduce to
half of the value it would have achieved without the expense.  Let’s take a look
at the math of compounding returns to see how quickly a portfolio’s value decays
with expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lump-sum-investment&quot;&gt;Lump-Sum Investment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the case of investing a lump-sum amount.  The compounded return
of the investment with a rate of return &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, after &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; years is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;final_value = initial_value * (1 + r)^N
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without any expenses eating into the return, the ratio of the final_value to
the initial value represents how much your portfolio would grow without expenses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;growth_without_expenses = final_value / initial_value
                        = (1 + r)^N
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider a expense or expense of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; being subtracted off of that return every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;final_value = initial_value * [(1 + r)(1 - e)]^N
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the growth is smaller,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;growth_with_expenses = final_value / initial_value
                     = [(1 + r)(1 - e)]^N
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to compute the half-life of these expenses, we want to know when the the growth
with expenses is half of the growth without those expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;growth_with_expenses / growth_without_expenses = 1/2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[(1 + r)(1 - e)]^N / (1 + r)^N = 0.5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving for &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; gives us the half-life as a function of expenses,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;N = log(0.5) / log(1-e)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it!  We now have an equation that directly computes how many years it takes
for a given expense to cut your total portfolio in half.  Notice that for a lump-sum
investment, it doesn’t matter how big your return is, it only matters what
the expense is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following plot I show the half-life as well as the 3/4-life and 7/8-life.
Losing half of your portfolio is terrible, but even losing a quarter or eighth
can be painful, especially when we’re talking about a portfolio that might
need to grow to over $1 million to support a comfortable retirement.  Do you want
to pay $125,000 (1/8 of $1M) or more in expenses over the course of your investment life?&lt;/p&gt;

    }
    return result;
  }

  nv.addGraph(newChart(halfLifeData, &#39;#halfLife-graph svg&#39;, true));

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me walk you through some key points from the graph above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want your half-life number to be very large which means you want to be as
  close to zero expenses as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2013/05/27/the-heavy-toll-of-investment-expenses/#3875f0443ebc&quot;&gt;According to Morningstar&lt;/a&gt;, in 2013 the “typical” managed fund of stocks has a expense of 1.2%.  Such a expense would eat up
  half of your gains in 57 years which seems like a long time.  But you would lose
  an eighth of your portfolio value in just 11 years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It gets even worse if you consider the “all-in” costs of actively managed funds.
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/sum/10.2469/faj.v70.n1.1&quot;&gt;John Bogle suggests&lt;/a&gt; that there are
  many unaccounted costs in an actively managed fund that can increase the actual
  “all-in” expense to something more like 2.21%.  The main unaccounted for costs are
  “transaction costs, cash drag, and sales loads”.  These extra costs are hard to
  quantify but they effectively can reduce your expected return beyond the published
  expenses.
  In any case, if you believe Bogle’s hypothesis, then an actively managed fund with
  a 2.2% expense has a half-life of only 31 years and a 7/8-life of just 6 years!
  That means that you could be losing as much as an eighth of your portfolio every
  6 years if you invest in actively-managed funds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contrast this with a leading low-cost index fund from Vanguard like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0585&amp;amp;FundIntExt=INT&quot;&gt;Total Stock Market Index&lt;/a&gt; fund (VTSAX)
  which has an expense ratio of 0.05%.  This expense would take 1385 years to lose half
  it’s value or 267 years to lose an eighth.  To put it another way, after 40 years
  an expense of 0.05% would only take 2.0% off of your portfolio value which is less
  than some funds would cost in a single year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, just about everybody knows that low-cost funds are a great way to invest and maximize
returns.
Putting these expenses in terms of how they eat away at your portfolio can be eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Super-Simple Virtual-Buffer Withdrawal Strategy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href=&quot;/the-30-30-withdrawal-strategy/&quot;&gt;30-30 Withdrawal Strategy&lt;/a&gt; is a
nice clean method for withdrawing money from your portfolio,
it does require you to keep track of a buffer which
drives the calculation for your withdrawal amount every year.
I felt like there should be a way to calculate the withdrawal in terms of only
your current withdrawal amount and your current portfolio value thus alleviating
the need to keep track of a separate spending buffer.
After playing with the math, it turns out there is a pretty simple formula
that achieves this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-bit-of-math&quot;&gt;A Bit of Math&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount that is initially spent from your portfolio is determined directly
by multiplying your withdrawal rate by your portfolio value.  Using the same
variables as the &lt;a href=&quot;/safe-withdrawal-rates-for-vampires/&quot;&gt;Safe Withdrawal Rates for Vampires&lt;/a&gt;
article,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;W = Pw
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;W = annual withdrawal amount
w = annual withdrawal rate
P = portfolio value
k = buffer size in years
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we have a buffer of &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; years, then the total buffer size initially
is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;initial buffer size = kW
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year of spending from the buffer, it is reduced by the withdrawal amount,
&lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt;.  So we are left with,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; buffer after 1 year of spending = kW-W = W(k-1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we add back an amount equal to the new portfolio value times the
withdrawal rate to arrive at the new buffer size,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; updated buffer value after 1 year = W(k-1) + Pw
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to compute the new withdrawal amount, we just divide this amount
by the size of the buffer in years (&lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new annual withdrawal amount = W(k-1)/k + Pw/k
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I prefer to think of my withdrawals as monthly, let’s rewrite this
in terms of monthly withdrawals,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new monthly withdrawal amount = (W/12)(k-1)/k + Pw/12k
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; are constant values, we now have a formula for computing
our new withdrawal amount from the current monthly withdrawal (&lt;code&gt;W/12&lt;/code&gt;),
and the current portfolio value (&lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-using-30-30-numbers&quot;&gt;Example Using 30-30 Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s put some numbers to this to make it less abstract.  Start with a
portfolio of &lt;code&gt;P = $720,000&lt;/code&gt; and go with the 30-30 Withdrawal Strategy numbers
for buffer size (&lt;code&gt;k = 2.5 years&lt;/code&gt;), and withdrawal rate (&lt;code&gt;w = 3.33%&lt;/code&gt;).
For these values, the initial monthly withdrawal is simply,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pw/12 = $720000*0.0333/12 = $2000/month
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can set aside your buffer of 2.5 years ($60,000) in a safe place.
But the beauty of this strategy is that you don’t have to do so.  You can also
just assume that your buffer is fully invested within the bond portion of your
portfolio; it’s up to you.  This is why I call it a “virtual” buffer because
you get the advantages the buffer gives you without having to keep track of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s assume a year has passed and it has been a good year and the portfolio
has gone up to $765,000.  Now your monthly withdrawal amount is computed as,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(W/12)(k-1)/k + Pw/12k = $2000(1.5/2.5) + $765000*.03333/(12*2.5))
                       = $2000 * 0.6 + $765000/900
                       = $1200 + $850
                       = $2050
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though the portfolio increased by 6.25% (&lt;code&gt;765000/720000&lt;/code&gt;), the monthly
spending only went up 2.5% (&lt;code&gt;2050/2000&lt;/code&gt;) due to the virtual 2.5-year buffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, look how simple the calculation is every year.  In this example, multiplying
your current income by 0.6, divide your portfolio by 900, and add those 2 numbers
together.  Pretty simple right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-it-even-simpler&quot;&gt;Making it Even Simpler&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As easy as this calculation is, I couldn’t help but noticing that dividing by
900 is a little awkward.  What if we changed the buffer size so that we ended
up dividing by 1000?  If we can divide by 1000 then the calculation can almost
be done in your head.  To state this mathematically, we want,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;12k/w = 1000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the annual withdrawal rate is fixed, then we solve for the buffer size to get,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;k = 1000w/12
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substituting this back into our withdrawal equation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new monthly withdrawal amount = (W/12)(1-0.012/w) + P/1000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisiting the first example with a portfolio of $720,000 and a withdrawal
rate of 3.333%, the first year withdrawal is still $2000/monthly because the
withdrawal rate is the same.  After the first year with a new portfolio value
of $765,000, the new monthly withdrawal now becomes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(W/12)(1-0.012/w) + P/1000 = $2000(1-0.012/0.03333) + $765000/1000
                           = $2000 * 0.64 + $765000/1000
                           = $1280 + $765
                           = $2045
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you can see that the slightly modified equation only decreased the income by
$5/month.  This decrease is due to a slightly larger buffer (2.778 years vs 2.5 years)
which means that the market gyrations are smoothed a little more than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-super-simple-virtual-buffer-withdrawal-formula&quot;&gt;The Super-Simple Virtual-Buffer Withdrawal Formula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize all the above math, in the first year of withdrawals, you withdrawal
from your portfolio by simply multiplying your portfolio value by your withdrawal
rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;initial monthly withdrawal = Pw/12
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after each year you compute your new withdrawal amount with this
super-simple formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new monthly withdrawal = M * beta + P/1000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;M = previous monthly withdrawal
beta = monthly withdrawal multiplier = 1 - 1.2%/w
w = annual withdrawal rate
P = current portfolio value
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph below shows the monthly withdrawal multiplier as a function of
annual withdrawal rate.  If you hover over the chart you will see other
information including a “Sample Allocation” which shows how you might need
to allocate more to stocks as your withdrawal rate goes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-portfolios&quot;&gt;Sample Portfolios&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few possible portfolio types you could choose from depending on your
risk tolerance.  The Step-By-Step section that follows walks through a simple example
using the “moderate” strategy numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;annual withdrawal rate&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;monthly withdrawal multiplier&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;virtual buffer size&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;conservative&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.40%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.00 yrs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;moderate&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3.00%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;0.6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.50 yrs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;moderately aggressive&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3.33%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;0.64&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.78 yrs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;aggressive&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4.00%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;0.7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3.33 yrs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-by-step&quot;&gt;Step-By-Step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the Super-Simple Virtual-Buffer Withdrawal strategy is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compute your initial monthly withdrawal from the equation &lt;code&gt;Pw/12&lt;/code&gt;.
For example, with a $400,000 portfolio (&lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;) and a 3% withdrawal rate (&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;),
your monthly withdrawal is,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$400,000*0.03/12 = $1000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Withdrawal from the portfolio for a full year using the last computed value.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of each year, compute your new monthly withdrawal rate using
the equation &lt;code&gt;M * beta + P/1000&lt;/code&gt;.  For example,
with a 3% withdrawal rate (&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;), your beta multiplier is &lt;code&gt;1 - 1.2%/3% = 0.6&lt;/code&gt;.
If your portfolio (&lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;) has increased to $420,000 after the first year,
then your new withdrawal is,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$1000*0.6 + $420000/1000 = $600 + $420 = $1020&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go back to step 2 and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nerd-alert&quot;&gt;Nerd Alert&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some readers may have noticed that the formula for this withdrawal strategy
looks an awful lot like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing&quot;&gt;exponential smoothed average&lt;/a&gt;.
If we rewrite the withdrawal formula like this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;M(t) = (1-alpha) * M(t-1) + alpha * Pw/12
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;alpha = 1.2%/w
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then you can see that it is indeed an exponential moving average of the
term &lt;code&gt;Pw/12&lt;/code&gt;.  That term represents the annual withdrawal rate projected down
to the monthly level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For exponential smoothed averages, a smaller &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; represents an average that has
a larger smoothing effect.  In the case of this withdrawal strategy,
the smaller &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to larger withdrawal rates which means that larger
withdrawal rates will have larger smoothing effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parting-thoughts&quot;&gt;Parting Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein has been attributed with the saying that “everything should be made
as simple as possible, but not simpler”.  The super-simple virtual-buffer withdrawal
strategy is simple and requires no bookkeeping other than checking your portfolio
value once a year.  Is there a simpler strategy?  Yes, you could simply
take a constant value out without checking your portfolio balance.
But such a strategy could be risky since it ignores the possibility of a
declining portfolio balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The super-simple strategy also has flexibility which comes from the fact that
the buffer is “virtual”.  Whether or not you keep an actual buffer is up to you.
Generally it’s a good idea to keep a couple years or so of spending outside
of your investments so that you know it will be there when you need it.  But this
strategy doesn’t require you do so, it’s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Affordable Care Act May Increase Your Marginal Tax Rate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you retire before you are eligible for Medicare at age 65, then you
may find yourself buying health insurance through one of the Affordable Care Act
health exchanges.
Furthermore, if your taxable income falls below 4 times the
Federal Poverty Level (FPL), then you will qualify for a subsidy which
could pay for a nice chunk of your health insurance premium.
For 2016 the FPL is set at $11,770 for singles and $15,930 for couples, so
you could be eligible for a tax credit for incomes below $47,080 (single) or
$63,720 (couples).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with marginal tax rates?  It turns out that the
subsidy is a tax credit which gradually decreases as your taxable income increases.
For example, if your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp&quot;&gt;modified adjusted gross income&lt;/a&gt;
(MAGI) is between 3 and 4
times the FPL ($47,790 to $63,720 for couples), then your tax credit decreases
by 9.56% for every extra dollar earned.  And even though it’s a credit and not
a tax, the effect of a decreasing credit is mathematically equivalent to a
tax because the end result is that you will have 9.56% less money in your
pocket for every dollar of increased income.  Adding that to the
marginal tax rate means that your &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; marginal tax rate is higher
if you’re in the income range where you receive a health care premium subsidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not bad to receive the tax credit because that’s free money.
But it’s good to understand how this affects your tax rate so that you
can plan on how and when to take income from your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marginal-tax-rates&quot;&gt;Marginal Tax Rates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pay your taxes, then you’re probably already well aware of the tax brackets,
from 10% all the way up to 39.6% for the highest earners.  This article is
focused on the 10% and 15% brackets because that’s where the ACA
credits occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, I’m just going to consider the simple case of a married
couple using the standard deduction ($12,600 in 2016) and the the personal
exemptions ($4,050 in 2016) which means that the first $20,700 of adjusted
gross income is tax free.  The same issue applies to single filers, just at
a lower income level.  Here’s a graph of the marginal tax rates versus income
for joint filers in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;brackets&quot; class=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you itemize deductions, this graph will shift to the right by the amount
that your deductions exceed the standard deduction ($12,600).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marginal-effects-of-tax-credit-decreases&quot;&gt;Marginal Effects of Tax Credit Decreases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS publishes a table that is used to calculate how much to reduce your
ACA subsidy by comparing your income to the Federal Povery Level (FPL).
This table can be found in Table 2 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8962.pdf&quot;&gt;instructions for Form 8962&lt;/a&gt;
which lists incomes levels from 100% through 400%.  For a married couple,
the FPL is $15,930, so 100% to 400% of FPL corresponds to incomes between
$15,930 and $63,720.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the IRS table publishes different values for each FPL percentage point,
I have computed the marginal tax effect for every 1%  of FPL ($159) between 100%
and 400% FPL to come up with the following graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;acacredits&quot; class=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down this chart by income ranges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$15,930 - 21,187 (100-133% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - in the lower range the premium subsidy is
 reduced by the smallest amount, 2.01%.  But many people in this range would be eligible
 for Medicaid and may choose to not buy insurance and thus may not be affected at all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$21,187 (133% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - there is a spike at this income level because there’s
 a jump in the subsidy reduction from 2.01% to 3.02%.  So as your income increases
 from 132% to 133% of FPL, your subsidy goes down by &lt;code&gt;133*.0302-132*.0201&lt;/code&gt; =
 136% ($217 more taxes for $159 increase in income).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$21,187 - 47,790 (133-300% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - in this range the IRS table publishes an
 ever increasing subsidy reduction rate which translates to a gradually
 increasing marginal tax rate.  The jaggedness is due the rounding of the values
 in the IRS table.  The average effect on marginal tax rate across this range is
 &lt;code&gt;(300*.0956-133*.0302)/(300-133)&lt;/code&gt; = 14.8%.
 At it’s peak it approaches 18.5% for incomes right below 300% of FPL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$47,740 - 63,720 (300-400% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - this is the top range in which a subsidy
 is available and the reduction is a constant 9.56% across the entire range.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$63,720 (400% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - technically there could be a huge spike (cliff) at this
 income level because when you make $63,720, you lose all remaining premium
 credits.  There could also be no spike if you choose the cheapest health care
 plan, in which case your premium subsidy may have already been exhausted
 at this income level.  I chose not to show it on the graph because it’s not a
 constant percentage for all situations but it’s important to be aware of this
 premium cliff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, you will see an increase anywhere from 9.56% to as much as 18.5% in
your effective marginal tax rate due to the reduction of the premium tax credit.
The average increase across the whole range (133-400%) is 12.8%.  Since this
occurs in the 10-15% income tax ranges, this is a big jump in marginal tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;effective-marginal-tax-rate&quot;&gt;Effective Marginal Tax Rate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next graph simply combines the marginal tax rates with the effects of the
reduction in premium subsidies to come up with the &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; marginal tax rate.
It’s somewhat startling to see that the effective marginal tax rates can be higher
than those for people earning over $96,000 (603% FPL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;effective&quot; class=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we normally think of as the 10% tax bracket is now approximately a 25% tax
bracket.  The lower end of the 15% tax bracket (below $48,000) has become a 32%
tax bracket.  And between $48,000 and $64,000 the marginal tax rate is nearly 25%.
We finally return to the 15% tax rate above $64,000 but lose the premium subsidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;capital-gains&quot;&gt;Capital Gains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term capital gains are are similarly affected.  Instead of having zero
marginal tax rates up to the 25% bracket, there are now significant marginal
effects in the 133-400% FPL range.  And in the 250-300% FPL range you would be
at a higher marginal rate (&amp;gt; 15%) than people with much higher incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;capgains&quot; class=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategies&quot;&gt;Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of this increase in marginal tax rate has colored my views on
how and when to take income from my portfolio.  It mostly boils down to the
concept of delaying my taxable income until age 65 when Medicare
kicks in and I no longer am eligible for ACA credits.  Alternatively, either
Mrs. Moneycle or I could get a job with health benefits, but that requires
working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things you can do to push income forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deplete taxable and Roth assets before touching IRA/401k funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perform tax-loss harvesting to capture losses now (taking gains after 65)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defer IRA to Roth conversions which produce taxable income&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move dividend-producing assets like bonds into IRAs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delay taking pensions and social security until after age 65&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When buying annuities, add a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)
  which gives you less income in the early years and more income later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use delayed income annuities which start at age 65 or beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If most of your investable assets are in tax-qualified accounts (IRA/401k),
then you may not be able to defer your taxable income as much.  In this case
I would recommend spreading your Roth and taxable asset withdrawals from now
until age 65 so that you can get a little benefit each year.  But you might
want to consider lumping those same assets over just a few years if it allows
you to push your income below 400% FPL and get a tax subsidy for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, if you are able to push income forward until age 65, you probably
want to take as much income as you can between ages 65 and 70 while staying
in the 15% tax bracket.  This is because at age 70, you will most likely begin
taking social security and also be required (at age 70.5) to take required minimum
distributions from your IRAs which all adds up to more taxable income.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the overall strategy is,
(1) take as little taxable income as possible while receiving ACA subsidies,
(2) take as much taxable income as possible while not receiving ACA subsidies, and
(3) make it to age 70 and thank your younger self for planning ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HSA Tax Advantages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This time of year has me thinking more about taxes than normal because I recently
took a first stab at income taxes for 2015.  While doing my taxes I noticed the
subject of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) coming up in a couple different places
so I thought I would share why HSAs can be an awesome place to invest your savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason that HSAs are great is the ability to pay for things with pre-tax
dollars.  Depending on your tax bracket, this can be a huge “investment”.  Consider
going to the doctor and spending $100 from an HSA with before-tax dollars.
If you had to use after-tax dollars for that same $100 expense, and you were in
the 25% tax bracket, you would need to earn $133.33 in order to have the $100 left
over to pay the doctor.  Or to look at it another way, by using an HSA
you avoided spending $33.33 before tax, which is $25 after tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put that mathematically, the money saved by using money
from an HSA instead of after-tax dollars is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;money_saved = (money_without_hsa - money_with_hsa)*(1-tax_rate)
money_without_hsa = invoice_amount/(1-tax_rate)
money_with_hsa = invoice_amount
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which reduces to,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;money_saved = invoice_amount*tax_rate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you know you are going to have X dollars in medical expenses, it behooves
you to have X dollars sitting in your HSA because you will save X dollars
multiplied by your marginal tax rate in after tax dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-hsa-uses&quot;&gt;Common HSA uses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common uses for HSAs are basic medial expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dentist - use your HSA card to pay for that cleaning or root canal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doctor - doctor bills could be has high as your deductible, so you probably
want to build your HSA up to the amount of your deductible to cover large
expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prescriptions - those Viagra pills are expensive!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vision - in addition to regular visits to the eye doctor, you can use HSA funds
to pay for eyeglasses and eye surgeries including laser surgeries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesser-known-hsa-uses&quot;&gt;Lesser Known HSA uses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to use HSA dollars that you may not have heard about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long-Term Care (LTC) premiums - there are limits, but LTC policy premiums
can be paid in part using HSA dollars.  The older you are, the more of your
premiums are allowed to be paid using HSA dollars.  For tax-year 2015 the
limits are as follows:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;40 years old and younger – $380&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;41–50 years old – $710&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;51–60 years old – $1,430&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;61–70 years old – $3,800&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;70 years old and older – $4,750&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medicare premiums - you can’t continue contributing to your HSA after you
hit medicare age (65).  But you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use your HSA funds to pay for supplemental
Medicare insurance such as Medicare Part B, D or Medicare Advantage.  This
is a good reason to contribute above and beyond your deductible level before
you hit age 65.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Construction expenses - as you get older, you may find you need to need to
make modifications to your house.  Construction expenses to accommodate
somebody with medical issues may be paid for using HSA funds.  Examples include
wheelchair ramps, hand rails, widening doorways, etc..&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vasectomy - pair your vasectomy operation with your Viagra prescription and
put the whole thing on your HSA debit card!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of other things you can use HSA funds for.  Check out
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf&quot;&gt;the IRS publication&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of investing, HSAs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments&quot;&gt;generally considered the 3rd priority&lt;/a&gt;
behind (1) getting your 401k match if you have it and (2) paying off credit cards.
Besides the advantages described above, HSAs also act like an IRA in that the
growth of funds inside the HSA are tax deferred.  While you can take the funds
out after age 65 and be taxed on them just like an IRA, it’s probably best to
leave your money in the HSA and continue using it to pay for medical expenses
until the HSA is drained.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vanguard Managed Payout Quacks Like a Buffered Withdrawal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1498&amp;amp;FundIntExt=INT&quot;&gt;Vanguard Managed Payout Fund&lt;/a&gt;
(VMP) is a fairly unique offering in the current landscape of mutual funds.
While some companies offer funds called “Income Replacement Funds”
which are designed to provide an income stream for a fixed period of years,
this Vanguard fund is the only fund that I know of that seeks to provide a
income stream indefinitely.  And the formula used to calculate this income
stream has similarities to the &lt;a href=&quot;/buffer-withdrawals-to-stabilize-income/&quot;&gt;buffered withdrawal strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vanguards-managed-payout-formula&quot;&gt;Vanguard’s Managed Payout Formula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula used to calculate monthly income for the VMP Fund can be
found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.vanguard.com/pub/Pdf/p1498.pdf&quot;&gt;the prospectus&lt;/a&gt;.
Here’s a screenshot of that formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vg-managed-payout-formula.png&quot; alt=&quot;managed payout formula&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left side of the equation, the thing that jumps out is that the income
is based on a 4% withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right hand side of the equation describes what value is being multiplied by 4%.
Since the overall formula represents the “Monthly distribution per share”,
we can estimate the monthly distribution dollar amount by multiplying
both sides by the number of shares owned.
This means our annual distribution is simply 4% of the average value
of the “hypothetical account” over the past 3 years.  By reading the prospectus,
the “hypothetical account” represents what the account balance would have been if
it had been held over the previous 3 years while receiving income according
to the above formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphically, the average of the hypothetical account is taken by averaging
the portfolio’s value each day over the past 3 years as illustrated below
(I was too lazy to fill in all days of each year so use your imagination).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vmp-daily-avg.png&quot; alt=&quot;daily average&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That average is then multiplied by 4% to determine the annual withdrawal amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this compare to what we do when we take buffered withdrawals from
a portfolio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buffered-withdrawal&quot;&gt;Buffered Withdrawal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea of a buffered withdrawal is that, once a year, you take a percentage
of your overall portfolio and move that into your spending buffer.  Then you
divide your spending buffer by your buffer size (in years) to arrive at your
income for the coming year.  This is illustrated for a 4-year buffer below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vmp-yearly-avg.png&quot; alt=&quot;yearly average&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the illustration, for the buffer calculation at the beginning of 2016,
the income would be approximately&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
income = withdrawal_rate * (V_2013 + V_2014 + V_2015 + V_2016) / 4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that this is 4 years instead of 3 because we are taking the 4 data points
at the beginning of each year.  This 4-year annual average would be closest in
value to the 3-year daily average that VMP uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;Comparison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between the VMP formula and the buffered
withdrawal formula is the averaging period.  The VMP formula averages the account
value daily whereas the buffered withdrawal averages once a year.
If those averages turn out to be the same then the equations will give the
same amount of income.
And intuitively, those averages will be pretty close to each other,
or at least “close enough” for the purposes of determining how much income to take.
The exception would be in years with sharp up or down turns, the daily average
could be a bit different than the annual average,
but I’m not sure that it would be qualitatively better.
In fact, an annual average will be “smoother” because it smooths out the effects
of sharp market turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think either method is hugely better than the other.  In both cases,
if the market is going up, the amount of income to be withdrawn in the next year
will go up at a related but smaller rate.  Likewise when the market goes down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it interesting that the Vanguard Managed Payout formula was pretty similar
in theory to the buffered withdrawal strategy.  Vanguard doesn’t call it a
buffered withdrawal but the effect is the same in that the effects of market swings
will be smoothed by averaging the account over recent valuations.  If you like
the idea of a 4-year buffer that withdrawals at a rate of 4% per year, then the
simplicity of the VMP fund might appeal to you.  But, if you would like more control
over your portfolio, buffer size and withdrawal rate, then you might prefer to follow
the withdrawal strategy outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;/buffer-withdrawals-to-stabilize-income/&quot;&gt;Buffered Withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;
article.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 30-30 Withdrawal Strategy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Withdrawing funds from your portfolio can be tricky.  On the one hand,
you want to make sure you take enough income to support your expenses.  On the other hand,
you want make sure you don’t run out of money by taking too much.
Most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Withdrawal_strategies&quot;&gt;withdrawal strategies&lt;/a&gt; break down as either a constant dollar or constant percentage or a hybrid of the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constant-dollar withdrawal strategies tend to start with some amount, like 4%, and take that dollar amount
each year.  Optionally, the amount could be increased to account for inflation each year.
While these constant dollar strategies are a great tool for academia to study the effects of different rates,
they have the possibility of failure (running out of money) if you continue to withdraw the same
amount of money without regard for what your portfolio is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constant-percentage withdrawal strategies get rid of the possibility of failure
by just taking a fixed percentage out of the portfolio every year,
regardless of what the market does.  This is an improvement over
constant dollar strategies because you can’t run out of money,
but it does mean that your income will be subject to the vagaries of the market.
If you can stomach those swings or have other sources of income to buffer
those swings, then this strategy might work fine for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “30-30 Withdrawal Strategy” described by this article has the advantages of a
constant-percentage strategy but attempts to buffer the market variations by using
shock-absorbing buffer.  The name of the strategy comes from the withdrawal rate and buffer size.
The basic idea of this strategy is that you move a fixed percentage of your portfolio (1/30) into
a spending buffer each year, then you take a fixed amount from that buffer (1/30)
for monthly living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/withdrawal-30-30.png&quot; alt=&quot;30-30 Withdrawals&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;withdrawal-rate-of-130&quot;&gt;Withdrawal Rate of 1/30&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “30-30 Withdrawal Strategy” uses a withdrawal rate of 3.33% for a couple of reasons.
First, it’s easy to remember.  Second and more importantly, it’s in the realm of
withdrawal rates that should, over time, allow you to keep up with inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does the 3.33% come from?  Recall from the &lt;a href=&quot;/safe-withdrawal-rates-for-vampires/&quot;&gt;Safe Withdrawal Rates for Vampires&lt;/a&gt; article that the safe withdrawal
rate for someone who needs their money to last forever is given by the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
withdrawal_rate &amp;lt;= (appreciation - inflation) / (1 + appreciation)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to know what future portfolio appreciation will be, but historically
a 50/50 stock/bond portfolio would have returned around 7-8%.  But when it comes to
retirement, I prefer to be a little more conservative.  So let’s chop about 2% off of 7.5%
to get a conservative future appreciation estimate of 5.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation is also a little tricky.  Currently inflation is running &lt;a href=&quot;http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/CurrentInflation.asp&quot;&gt;close to zero&lt;/a&gt; but
the Fed has said that they are aiming to keep it close to 2%.  So, for the sake
of this calculation, let’s assume the Fed is able to keep inflation near 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plugging those numbers into the above equation, we get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
withdrawal_rate &amp;lt;= (0.055 - 0.02) / (1 + 0.055) = 3.32%
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This withdrawal rate is also very close to 1/30 which means that you can just
divide your entire portfolio value by 30 to arrive at the amount needed for
an annual withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may disagree with the assumptions or have a different type of investment portfolio
with different return assumptions.  But understanding how I arrived at the
number may allow you to choose your own number for the withdrawal rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;month-buffer&quot;&gt;30-month Buffer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffering the annual withdrawals will help to smooth out the bumps in the portfolio
returns.  The idea of the buffer is that, each year, you take your annual withdrawal and immediately
put that into your income buffer.  Then you divide that income buffer by the size
of the buffer in months to arrive at your income level for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a 30-month buffer is frankly, somewhat arbitrary.  I chose 30 months (2.5 years)
partly because it has the number 30 in it, but also because I personally want to keep
the buffer relatively small so that I can keep as much of my portfolio invested as
possible. As with the withdrawal rate, you can use a buffer size of your choosing.
The bigger the buffer is, the smoother your income variations will be, but a bigger
buffer also means that less of your money is invested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-by-step&quot;&gt;Step-by-Step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go through an example portfolio to see how this works.  First, let’s start
with a portfolio of $900,000 (it divides by 30 nicely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create your initial spending buffer by dividing your portfolio by 30
  then multiplying by 2.5.  This represents 2.5 years worth of future spending so
  put it in a safe place like an interest-bearing account, short-term bonds, money-market,
  or similar.  For the example $900,000 portfolio, $900,000/30 = $30,000 so you would
  put $75,000 into your initial buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Divide your buffer balance by 30 to get your monthly income level and set up an
  automatic withdrawal of that amount that goes into your spending/checking account.
  In our example, $75,000/30 = $2500/month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Live off of the income for 12 months.  After 12 months your buffer should
  have approximately $45,000 left in it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of each year, recompute your portfolio value and move 1/30 of it
  into your buffer.  In our example, let’s assume that the invested portion
  of $825,000 increased to $885,000.  Add that to the remaining buffer ($45,000)
  to get your new portfolio value of $930,000.  Divide that by 30 and move that
  amount into your spending buffer.  $930,000/30 = $31,000.  Your spending buffer
  should now have $76,000.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go back to Step 2 and repeat annually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that I am including the buffer as part of the overall portfolio
value when doing the above calculations.  If you prefer to keep it separate from
the investment portfolio, then you could use a divisor of 27.5 (instead of 30)
on just the investment portfolio to achieve similar results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astute readers might notice that, even though the investment portfolio increased
by (885/825) 7.3%, the income in the next year will only rise by (76000/75000) 1.33%
which is below our assumed inflation rate of 2%.
This is because the initial buffer was created without taking inflation into account.
Over time this effect should go away and the average increases will keep pace with inflation.
If you want to take that into account from the get-go, you could create a smaller
initial buffer (e.g. 2.4x) which means you would receive less income initially.
But, I personally prefer to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; with a slightly larger income and suffer
the smaller initial income adjustment until the buffering “catches up”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variation-different-withdrawal-rates&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variation:&lt;/em&gt; Different Withdrawal Rates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The withdrawal rate of 3.33% was chosen with a fair amount of hand-waving but represents
what I would consider to be a fairly safe rate that has a reasonable chance of keeping up
with inflation.  However, if you’re a risk taker and/or have other streams of income to
buffer your income, then higher rates aren’t unreasonable.  For example, if you are
comfortable with a 4% withdrawal, then you could use 25 as your divisor instead of 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, maybe you could start with 30 then decrease it until you settle in on
a number that seems to suit you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variation-different-buffer-sizes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variation:&lt;/em&gt; Different Buffer Sizes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 2.5 years is a handy size for the “30-30 Strategy”, it’s certainly not written in stone.
For example a 6-year strategy might play well into a Roth ladder if so you might choose to create
a buffer of 72 months.  Bigger buffers also have the advantage of smoothing out the
investment returns even more and giving you a more predictable income stream.  But the downside
of larger buffers is removing money from your investment pool so you might want to consider investing part
of a larger buffer into a medium-term bond fund or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “30-30 Withdrawal Strategy” is an easy mechanism for taking income from a portfolio.
Divide your portfolio by 30 to figure out much to put into your spending buffer.
Then divide the spending buffer by 30 to figure out how much to withdraw as income every month.
Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
