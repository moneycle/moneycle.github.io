        <title>Maximize Your Employer Match before Using a Roth 401(k)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While the Roth 401(k) is still a fairly new&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; option in the 401(k) world,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://aon.mediaroom.com/2014-04-28-Aon-Hewitt-Analysis-Finds-More-Employers-Adding-Roth-Features-to-Expand-Savings-Options&quot;&gt;half of employers&lt;/a&gt;
now offer a Roth option.  While contributing
to a Roth is not necessarily the best choice for everyone, it can be a good
choice for younger workers who haven’t reached their peak earnings potential
(and tax bracket).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, younger workers also tend to be those who are struggling to survive and
may have a hard time contributing enough to get the full match that their employer
provides.  For workers in this donut hole, it may make more sense
to contribute to the traditional 401(k) to get the maximum benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a hypothetical example.  Let’s say your employer matches 50% of
your contribution up to 8%.  So if you are able to contribute 8%, the company
will match 4%.  And let’s assume you are single and making $75,000 which puts
you in the 25% tax bracket. Further, let’s assume that the most
you can afford to contribute to your 401(k) is $6,000 (before taxes)
or 8% of your income.  In other words, in order to cover your cost of living,
you need an income stream of $69,000/year after your 401(k) contributions are taken out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re contributing to a Roth, your $6000 becomes $4,500 after taxes which
is how much you can actually afford to contribute.  In this scenario,
you are getting 3% of the company match, but are missing out on the other 1% of
free money that your company could match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if you defer your taxes and contribute the entire $6,000 to a traditional
401(k), you will get the entire match from your employer which amounts to an
additional $750 added to your 401(k).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Roth 401(k)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Traditional 401(k)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Gross Income&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$75,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$75,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;401(k) Contribution&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$4,500&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$6,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;401(k) Taxes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1,500&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$0 (deferred)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Livable Income&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$69,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$69,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Employer Match&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$2,250&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, eventually you will have to pay taxes on your traditional 401(k)
contribution.  If your future tax rate is still 25%, then you will pay the same
$1,500 (adjusted for gains) as you would have in the Roth case.  So you’re still
ahead by $750 (plus future gains).  Or in percentage terms, you would be ahead by
&lt;code&gt;(6000(1-0.25)+3000)/(6000-1500+2250)&lt;/code&gt; or 7.14%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are able to reduce your tax rate in retirement, which most early retirees
do, then the gain is even higher.  For example, if you pull your money out while in
a 15% tax bracket, then your potential gain is &lt;code&gt;(6000(1-0.15)+3000)/(6000-1500+2250)&lt;/code&gt;
or 20%!  A 20% future gain just by picking the right type of 401(k) is a pretty
big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if your rate is higher in the future?  At what higher tax rate would you
break even?  To figure that out we solve the equation
&lt;code&gt;6000(1-rate)+3000 = 6000(1-0.25)+2250&lt;/code&gt; which gives a rate of 37.5%.
That means your future tax rate would have to be above 37.5% in order for the
Roth to be the right choice in this scenario.
And since you’d have to earn over $425,000 to hit the 39% tax rate, this is
what I would call a good problem to have and you can afford to hire a
financial advisor to help you figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;counter-example&quot;&gt;Counter Example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you have enough money to contribute fully to either a Roth or a traditional
401(k)?  In the above example, instead of assuming you can invest $6000, let’s assume
you can invest $8,000 (and live off of $67,000) which will give you the maximum
employer match either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Roth 401(k)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Traditional 401(k)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Gross Income&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$75,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$75,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;401(k) Contribution&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$6,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$8,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;401(k) Taxes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$2,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$0 (deferred)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Livable Income&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$67,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$67,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Employer Match&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$3,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, it comes down to what your current tax rate is versus your future
tax rate.  With these numbers the comparison is between &lt;code&gt;(8000(1-current_tax)+3000)&lt;/code&gt;
(Roth) and &lt;code&gt;(8000(1-future_tax)+3000)&lt;/code&gt; (traditional).  In other words, the decision
comes down to a simple comparison of tax rates and whether you think you will be
able to reduce your future tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s actually more to it than that.
It’s really a comparison between today’s &lt;em&gt;marginal&lt;/em&gt; tax
rate versus your retirement’s &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; tax rate&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Why?  Because if you’re living
off of your money in the future, some of the money you withdraw will be at a 0%
tax rate, and some at 10%, and so-on up to your marginal tax rate.
So even if your future marginal tax rate is the same as your current tax rate,
your future total tax rate would be lower because you have to fill
in those lower tax buckets first.  In other words, there’s a good chance that the
traditional 401(k) will still fare better than the Roth 401(k) if you don’t
inflate your future lifestyle spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Younger workers in lower tax brackets are often encouraged to invest in the Roth
option provided by their employers so that they can take advantage of their lower
career tax rates.  However, these workers should also consider that they could
be giving up free money if they are unable to contribute up to the full value
matched by their employers.  When in doubt, make sure you
get your full employer match using traditional 401(k) contributions before
contributing to a Roth 401(k).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Take Early IRA Withdrawals without Penalty</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like many early retirees, then you may find most
of your savings are tied up in your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredaccount.asp&quot;&gt;tax-deferred accounts&lt;/a&gt;
like traditional 401k or IRA accounts when you are ready to retire.
If you are younger than 59.5 years old,
then how do you withdraw your funds without penalty?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three possible choices for withdrawing your money without penalty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roth Ladder - a Roth ladder is where you convert your traditional IRA
  funds to Roth then withdraw them 5 years later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Annuities - traditional IRA funds can be used to purchase a single premium
  immediate annuity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Substantially Equal Period Payments (SEPP) - also referred to as 72(t) which
  is the section of the tax code that allows this withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-sepp&quot;&gt;Why SEPP?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I prefer the Roth Ladder approach for withdrawing fund, it may not be enough
to meet your spending needs if you don’t have enough in your Roth to begin with.
Annuities have their place in retirement too, but for early retirees they are
less attractive (rates go up as you get older).  The SEPP withdrawal can help
fill the spending gap until you are 59.5 at which point you will have other
options to avoid penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sepp-rules&quot;&gt;SEPP Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things you need to be aware of when setting up a SEPP
withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The account you from which you do you SEPP withdrawals needs to be a stand-alone
  account.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You cannot trade in or out of the SEPP account after the payments have begun.
  Doing so will result in stiff penalties, so don’t do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must continue withdrawals for at least 5 years and until you are age
  59.5 or greater.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must calculate your withdrawal using one of three methods:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;amortization&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;annuitization&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;required-minimum distributions (RMD)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ever get audited you may need to show the calculation, so document
  the calculation and save it somewhere you can find later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are 3 approved methods for withdrawing your money, I suggest you stick
with amortization.  The RMD method will give the smallest amount of money, especially
for younger retirees, since it is just your account value divided by your remaining
life expectancy. Amortization and annuitization tend to result in similar payouts
that are both larger than RMD.  And a larger payout is good because it means you can
use a smaller portion of your retirement funds for the SEPP withdrawals and retain some
flexibility with your remaining funds.  Between amortization and annuitization
I prefer the amortization method because it is a easier to calculate and
therefore less prone to error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup-the-sepp-account&quot;&gt;Setup the SEPP Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have decided to setup a SEPP withdrawal, the first thing you should do
is create a separate account inside of your existing brokerage account.  For example,
if you have funds at Vanguard, you can break your accounts into separate sub-accounts
that each have their own set of funds in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount you put into your SEPP account depends largely on the calculation
you’ll be doing below.  I recommend that you first determine how much &lt;strong&gt;income&lt;/strong&gt; you
will need from the SEPP withdrawal and then reverse the calculation to determine how much
money to put into your newly created account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;doublecheck-the-calculation&quot;&gt;Doublecheck the Calculation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are three ways to do this calculation: spreadsheet formula, web calculators
and good old mathematics. All 3 methods should give you the same number so it’s
a good idea to try at least 2 of these methods to sanity check that you’re doing
it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of these methods, you will need the following 3 numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rate&lt;/code&gt; = 120% of the Applicable Federal Rate.  Don’t worry, you’re not alone,
  nobody else has heard of this number either.  It’s a number that the IRS
  publishes monthly and can be
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/federalRates.html&quot;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.
  You are allowed to choose one of the past 2 months when you do the calculation
  but to be safe I would just choose the rate from the most recent month.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;expectancy&lt;/code&gt; = your remaining life expectancy in years.  This is also published
  by the IRS and can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590b.pdf&quot;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.
  Look in Appendix B for the life expectancy tables using the age you will be on
  your birthday this year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;principal&lt;/code&gt; = the size of the account you will be taking distributions from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spreadsheet-formula&quot;&gt;Spreadsheet Formula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheet formula that I have tested using Google Spreadsheet is simply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=-pmt(rate, expectancy, principal)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give you the amount you can withdraw annually so divide by 12 if you
are going to make monthly withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sepp-calculators&quot;&gt;SEPP Calculators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several calculators that will help you figure out the SEPP withdrawals.
I recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://72t.net/72t/Calculator/Distributions&quot;&gt;72t.net Calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dinkytown.net/java/Retire72T.html&quot;&gt;Dinkytown Calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer the 72t.net calculator since it gives results to the nearest penny.
But go ahead and verify that you get the same number to the nearest dollar from
both calculators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;math-equation&quot;&gt;Math Equation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the mathematically inclined, you can also plug your numbers into
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_calculator#The_formula&quot;&gt;the annuity formula&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
income = principal * rate / (1 - (1+rate)^-expectancy)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;account-size-needed-for-a-desired-income&quot;&gt;Account Size Needed for a Desired Income&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking about using SEPP withdrawals, there’s a good chance that you
already know how much income you need and just want to figure out how much principal
you need to put aside to generate that income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach would be to calculate how much income you get from $100,000 then
use that to figure out how much you need for your desired income level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say you want an annual income of $12,000,
the current mid-term rate is 2.04%, and your remaining life expectancy is 36 years.
Plugging in those numbers for $100,000 of principal gives you an income of $3,948.53.
To get to your desired income of $12,000 you then divide $12,000 by $3,948.53 and
multiply by $100,000 to arrive at a principal of $303,910.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more direct approach, is to invert the ‘math equation’ above and calculate
your payment directly with this formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
principal = income * (1 - (1+rate)^-expectancy) / rate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, once you arrive at what you think the correct principal amount is,
double check it by any of the above methods to make sure it gives you the desired
income.  Then set aside that amount in an account that you won’t touch except to
do the SEPP withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEPP withdrawals aren’t for everyone.  But if you find yourself in a situation
where you need to use them, this article should help you figure out how to do the
calculations needed. Regardless of what happens in the market you should
continue withdrawing the exact same amount, so have your brokerage do
an automatic withdrawal so that you aren’t tempted to mess with it.
Also, don’t forget that you will need to pay income taxes on your withdrawals
since this is just income that you deferred from the past.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Penny Saved Is Four Dollars Earned</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve all heard the phrase “a penny saved is a penny earned”, which is usually
attributed to Benjamin Franklin, inventor of the bifocals.
And while Benjamin Franklin is revered by the monocle-loving crowd,
his adage does not accurately represent the true worth of a penny saved in the
context of an early retirement.  Let’s take a look at what a penny saved in your
monthly expenses equals in terms of how much money you need to save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retirement-income&quot;&gt;Retirement Income&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When thinking about retirement income, a good rule-of-thumb is to use the 4% rule.
This isn’t a hard and fast rule, but it does give us a good idea of how much
money we need to save for a particular income.  For example, a portfolio of
$300,000 can reasonably be expected to generate an income of $12,000 per year
(4% of $300,000), or $1000 per month.  Conversely, if we want an
income of $1000 per month, we need to save 300 times that amount in our retirement
account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we talk about income needs in retirement, all we’re really talking about
is covering our living expenses.  So, if we can reduce our expenses by
$1 per month, then we can retire with $300 less in our portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;taxes&quot;&gt;Taxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accounting for taxes can be a little more tricky because the tax rate depends
on when the money is taxed.  If it is taxed while you are in your peak earning
years, you might be paying a combined 33% or more federal and state taxes,
not to mention sales tax on whatever your are spending your money on.
But after retirement, you should be in a lower tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument, let’s assume you have deferred your taxes until retirement
and that the money you’re spending is coming out of a traditional IRA.
And let’s say you’re in the 15% federal bracket, 5% state and 5% sales tax.
It’s pretty easy to get to 25% combined taxes even at lower tax brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this 25% tax rate, instead of saving $300 now to spend $1 later, we would
have to save $400.  So, if you start with $400, and subtract 25%, or $100 for
taxes, then you arrive at the $300 needed to sustain $1 in monthly spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In equation form, you need to save &lt;code&gt;$300/(1-tax_rate)&lt;/code&gt; to sustain a dollar of monthly
expenses.  For example, if you’re combined tax rate is 40%, then the
amount you need to earn to save for a $1 monthly expense would be &lt;code&gt;$300/0.6&lt;/code&gt; or $500!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monthly-expenses&quot;&gt;Monthly Expenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the $400 multiplier from above, consider some typical monthly expenses and their
impact on your savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;If you will be spending …&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;You need to save…&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;$8 your Hulu subscription&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$3,200&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;$30 to have your dachshund bathed&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$12,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;$50 extra on your phone bill&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$20,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;$100 extra on your cable bill&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$40,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The math on this is easy to do in your head, which is partly why I chose the
25% tax rate for our examples.  Multiplying by 400 is simply multiplying by
2 twice then adding 2 zeroes.  So, when you consider the money you need to
save to cover a cost of say, $6.35, times 2 is $12.70, times 2 is $25.40,
and add 2 zeros to arrive at $2540.  You don’t need a fancy monocle to do
that in your head!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;daily-expenses&quot;&gt;Daily Expenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily expenses have an even bigger impact per dollar.  If you consider a daily
expense to be around 25 times per month, then you need 25*$400, or $10,000,
to cover every $1 of daily expenses in the future.
The math couldn’t be easier, just add 4 zeros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;If you will be spending …&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;You need to save…&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;$1 to have your monocle cleaned&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$10,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;$2 for a fountain drink with lunch&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$20,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;$5 for a venti Starbucks Frappucino&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$50,000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you can’t live without your Starbucks, maybe just downgrading to the
grande size will save you $10,000.  And maybe you could even learn to clean
your own damn monocle and save another $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a little bit loose with the numbers partially because it’s hard to
know exactly what your withdrawal and tax rates will be.  But the point of this
article is to give you some ballpark numbers with which to evaluate whether an
added expense is worth it.  Simply put, to figure out how much money you’ll
need to support a spending level in retirement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for monthly expenses, multiply the expense by 400.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for daily expenses, multiply the expense by 10,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this rule-of-thumb will help you think about the impact of
spending on your retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
