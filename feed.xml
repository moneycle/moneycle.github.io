&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most often when you see an article discussing whether to choose a Roth
over a Traditional option (401k/403b/IRA), the decision is stated as a comparison
between current and future tax rates.  While that’s mostly correct advice,
it fails to recognize that future withdrawals tend to occur across &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt;
tax brackets while current contributions tend to be in a single tax bracket.
I first became aware of the concept of filling in lower tax brackets from an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://thefinancebuff.com/case-against-roth-401k.html&quot;&gt;excellent piece written by The Finance Buff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first of two articles, I take a look at an ideal-world example that
explores the concept of how much should go towards a Roth versus a Traditional
option.  In the second article, I will take a look at some more real-world
cases that should give more concrete advice on how to determine how much to
contribute to each option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basics-of-roth-vs-traditional&quot;&gt;Basics of Roth vs Traditional&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s discuss the basic differences between the Roth and Traditional
options.  The most important difference between the two options is &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; you are taxed.
Roth options are taxed now in that you fund them with after-tax dollars and you are not
taxed again when you withdrawal the funds.  Traditional options
are taxed later, so you deduct your contributions from your taxes now and pay
income taxes later when you make withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to maximize how much money you keep, the basic tradeoff becomes
one of shifting the taxes to the point in time when you have the lower tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the tax rates are equal now and in the future, then mathematically the amount
you end up with is identical after the taxes are accounted for.  However, in this
case I recommend using the Roth option primarily because the Roth has fewer
requirements on the distribution of funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tradeoff&quot;&gt;The Tradeoff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding how much money to allocate to a Roth, the basic goal is to allocate
funds to the Roth that will be taxed at the same rate or higher in
the future.  Conversely, all funds that will fall into lower tax brackets in the
future should be allocated to the Traditional option now.
This last part is where most people fail to consider the whole picture.
Just because you may be in the same or even higher tax brackets
in the future does NOT mean that some of the funds won’t be taxed at a lower rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;filling-up-the-tax-brackets&quot;&gt;Filling Up The Tax Brackets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make a contribution to a Traditional IRA/401k/403b today,
in most cases all of that contribution will be in your current income tax bracket.
Sometimes you might also cross over to the next lower tax-bracket when making a
contribution if you are near a tax boundary when you begin your contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the future, when you start making withdrawals from your Traditional IRA,
your withdrawals start filling in the tax brackets from the bottom up.
I like to visualize this as pouring money into the income “funnel” as depicted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not-funnel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Money Funnel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, for a married couple filing jointly, the personal exemption plus standard
deduction is $20,700 so that amount is taxed at 0% (which I think of as the 0% tax
bracket).  Then the 10% bracket swallows up the next $18,550 of income, and the
15% bracket gets the next $56,750, and so on.  I have made the tax brackets to
appear as funnel-shaped because the brackets get bigger as income increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, most people will have other sources of income filling in the lower
tax brackets, and we will consider that case too.
But the key point is that future withdrawals fill in tax
brackets from the bottom up before reaching today’s marginal tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the goal of an investor should be to &lt;strong&gt;plan for today’s Traditional
contributions to fill up tomorrow’s lower tax brackets&lt;/strong&gt;, then
&lt;strong&gt;invest the remainder in the Roth option&lt;/strong&gt;.
That sounds easy on the surface, but the hard part is figuring out how
to translate that statement into actionable numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saving-within-a-single-tax-bracket&quot;&gt;Saving within a Single Tax Bracket&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;funnel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not-120-16.png&quot; alt=&quot;Earn 120, Save 16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by looking at a typical example where somebody has all of their
savings occur within a single marginal tax bracket.
Consider a married couple named Jon &amp;amp; Sally that makes a total income of $120,000
and saves a total of $16,000 to their retirement plans.  If that money
is saved in a Traditional retirement plan then they would have a
gross income (AGI) of $104,000.
With the standard deduction, the low-end of the 25% tax bracket occurs at $96,000
of gross income so the $104,000 puts them $8,000 above the lower threshold of
the 25% tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s further assume that they are saving all they can afford to and that the
$104,000 of income represents their current AND future day-to-day expenses.  This is
a bit of a stretch, but I would argue that most people’s spending habits don’t
change all that much when they transition into retirement.  You will probably be
spending more in some areas in less in others but basically your spending
profile won’t change by a drastic amount in retirement.
Mostly I’m just trying to get a baseline equation, so stick with me for now.
If that $104,000 of income represents what they need in the future (albeit in
today’s dollars),
that suggests that in the future their “livable income” would be roughly $8000
into the 25% tax bracket.  In the extreme case where this couple has no other sources of
retirement income, that would mean they would need about 96k/104k (92%) of their
withdrawals to occur in tax brackets below 25% and the remaining 8k/104k (8%)
would come out in the 25% tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you knew that your future funds would come out in the same tax bracket, then
those funds might as well go into a Roth account today.  So in this example,
the couple could contribute 8% to their Roth.  Mathematically,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = (livable_income - tax_threshold) / livable_income
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assigning variables,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;L = livable_income = current_income - max_savings
T = tax_threshold
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = (L - T) / L
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-income-sources&quot;&gt;Other Income sources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one assumption that is hard to ignore is that the couple has no other
income sources in retirement.  But almost everybody has at least one other
source of income such as Social Security or pensions, and many people will
have multiple sources of income.  So let’s adjust the math to account for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;funnel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not-120-16-36.png&quot; alt=&quot;Earn 120, Save 16, Base 36&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Jon &amp;amp; Sally expect to receive other income in the form of social security
that will total $36,000/year in today’s dollars, then their savings don’t have
to provide the full $104,000 of income.  Their savings only have to fill the
funnel up between $36,000 and $104,000, which is a difference of $68,000.
So when they convert their nest egg to future
income, 8k/68k or about 12% of that future income is in the same tax bracket
they are saving in today.  That suggests that they
could save 12% today in a Roth because it would likely be in the same tax
bracket if deferred to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modifying the first equation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = (L - T) / (L - B)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;B = base income from &quot;other&quot; sources (in today&#39;s dollars)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing what your future base income from “other” sources can be a difficult
thing to figure out.  But if you’re only expecting Social Security, I suggest
you start off with about 40% of your current income.  This is a &lt;strong&gt;very rough&lt;/strong&gt;
estimate based on the idea that, on average, people receive around 40% of their
income back in social security.  But you really should take a look at your
actual social security (or equivalent) statements to get an idea of how much
you’ll really get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At what point does 100% of your total savings go towards a Roth?  Mathematically,
if &lt;code&gt;(L-T) &amp;gt; (L-B)&lt;/code&gt; the equation goes above 100%.  This simplifies to the
comparison of &lt;code&gt;B &amp;gt; T&lt;/code&gt;.  So you should contribute everything to Roth when your
“base income” sources equal or exceed
your current lower tax threshold.  That makes sense because it means that
if you know that you will be at or above the current tax rate in the future
you might as well contribute everything to Roth today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just modify the equation slightly to account for this scenario,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = min((L - T) / (L - B), 100%)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saving-across-multiple-tax-brackets&quot;&gt;Saving Across Multiple Tax Brackets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;funnel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/roth_or_not-120-30-36.png&quot; alt=&quot;Earn 120, Save 30, Base 36&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s consider the case where Jon &amp;amp; Sally, are able to save enough to cross
over into a lower tax bracket if the entire savings were deductible.  So consider
with the same $120,000 of income and a savings rate of $30,000 per year.
This suggests that they are able to live comfortably off of the remaining $90,000
of income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the bottom of the 25% tax bracket is at $96,000, Jon &amp;amp; Sally would then
be descending into the 15% marginal tax bracket.  Since we’re assuming that
the $90,000 of income represents their future income needs and $90,000 of income
would be marginally taxed at 15%, everything they save in the 25% tax bracket
should simply go to the Traditional savings option.  Then they would apply the
equation from earlier but only to the portion in the 15% tax bracket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first $24,000 of savings goes into Traditional.  The remaining $6000 of
savings would follow the previous equation, &lt;code&gt;(90000-39250)/(90000-36000)&lt;/code&gt; or
94% of $6000, that goes to Roth.  Notice that I’m using $39,250 as the low end
of the tax bracket because that’s where the 15% tax bracket bottoms out (for a
married couple using standard deductions).  Finishing the
math for this example, 94% of $6000 is &lt;code&gt;0.94*6000/30000&lt;/code&gt; or about 19% of the
overall savings that goes to Roth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, we can express the overall equation
for the dual-tax bracket case like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;percent_to_roth = everything in lowest tax bracket * previous equation
                = min((T1-L) / S, 100%) * min((L - T0) / (L - B), 100%)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;S = total amount saved
L = livable_income
T0 = tax bracket threshold below L
T1 = tax bracket threshold above L
B = future base income
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a plot of what Roth percentage looks like versus income levels
for a married couple&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in 2016 with a savings rate of
&lt;span class=&quot;savings-rate&quot;&gt;12%&lt;/span&gt; and a future
base income equal to &lt;span class=&quot;base-percent&quot;&gt;40%&lt;/span&gt; of their current income
(move sliders below the graph to change percentages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;insights&quot;&gt;Insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the plot of Roth percent versus income and playing with the sliders gives
a few of insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Roth savings rate drops off rapidly right above each tax bracket.  This is due
  to the fact that your savings at those income levels can quickly push
  you into a lower tax bracket.   So if you save enough to cross over into
  a lower tax bracket, all of the savings in the
  higher tax brackets would tend to go towards the Traditional option, while
  most of the savings that cross-over into lower tax brackets would go towards
  the Roth option.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Roth savings rates tend to peak just below the tax bracket boundaries.
  That’s because you are as far away as you can be from the lower edge of the
  tax bracket which means that a higher percentage of your retirement income
  is likely to be in the same tax bracket (or higher) as you are in now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increases to future income pushes the entire curve up.  This means that the more
  you expect to earn from other sources such as social security and pensions,
  the closer your retirement tax bracket will be to your current tax bracket
  so you would tend to want to save more to a Roth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-you-assume-you-make-me-read-part-2&quot;&gt;When You Assume, You Make Me Read Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this analysis is interesting and moving the sliders around is fun, there
are many assumptions that make it not particularly useful.  Here are some of
the more egregious assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The model assumes that the investor will retire exactly when they have enough
  to retire without considering the probability that most people will either have
  too little or too much at the time of retirement.  Assuming you work a little
  past the point of being financially independent, then you would probably want to
  allocate a little more to the Roth option because the extra savings in the
  Traditional option would fill up the lower tax brackets in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Returns on the invested funds and inflation were both ignored.  If your
  investments beat inflation then the amount you have at retirement
  to fill in lower tax brackets would be larger.
  This also suggests allocating more funds to Roths.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employer matches were completely ignored.  Since those matching funds would
  normally be in before-tax dollars, this would tend to suggest higher allocations
  towards the Roth option than shown in this analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Part 2 I’m going to change the perspective of the analysis from mostly theoretical
to be a bit more practical.  Also, instead of focusing how much to put
in a &lt;strong&gt;Roth&lt;/strong&gt;, I will change the perspective slightly to examine how much total
money you should save in your &lt;strong&gt;Traditional&lt;/strong&gt; savings option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the plot, I capped the qualified contribution at $48,000 because each person in a couple over 50 can contribute a max of $24,000 to qualified accounts. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Radioactive Half-Life of Expenses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the world of science, the term “half-life” is used to describe &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life&quot;&gt;“the time required
for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value”&lt;/a&gt;.
One common application of this concept is for radioactive decay and the half-life
is a useful measure in science to characterize how quickly something will decay over
time.  Probably the most common application of this concept is used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating&quot;&gt;carbon dating&lt;/a&gt; which allows scientists
to fairly accurately estimate the age of objects containing radiocarbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that portfolio expenses can have a similar effect as radioactive
decay.  Namely, the higher the expense, the faster your portfolio will reduce to
half of the value it would have achieved without the expense.  Let’s take a look
at the math of compounding returns to see how quickly a portfolio’s value decays
with expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lump-sum-investment&quot;&gt;Lump-Sum Investment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the case of investing a lump-sum amount.  The compounded return
of the investment with a rate of return &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, after &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; years is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;final_value = initial_value * (1 + r)^N
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without any expenses eating into the return, the ratio of the final_value to
the initial value represents how much your portfolio would grow without expenses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;growth_without_expenses = final_value / initial_value
                        = (1 + r)^N
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now consider a expense or expense of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; being subtracted off of that return every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;final_value = initial_value * [(1 + r)(1 - e)]^N
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the growth is smaller,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;growth_with_expenses = final_value / initial_value
                     = [(1 + r)(1 - e)]^N
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to compute the half-life of these expenses, we want to know when the the growth
with expenses is half of the growth without those expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;growth_with_expenses / growth_without_expenses = 1/2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[(1 + r)(1 - e)]^N / (1 + r)^N = 0.5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving for &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; gives us the half-life as a function of expenses,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;N = log(0.5) / log(1-e)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it!  We now have an equation that directly computes how many years it takes
for a given expense to cut your total portfolio in half.  Notice that for a lump-sum
investment, it doesn’t matter how big your return is, it only matters what
the expense is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following plot I show the half-life as well as the 3/4-life and 7/8-life.
Losing half of your portfolio is terrible, but even losing a quarter or eighth
can be painful, especially when we’re talking about a portfolio that might
need to grow to over $1 million to support a comfortable retirement.  Do you want
to pay $125,000 (1/8 of $1M) or more in expenses over the course of your investment life?&lt;/p&gt;

    }
    return result;
  }

  nv.addGraph(newChart(halfLifeData, &#39;#halfLife-graph svg&#39;, true));

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me walk you through some key points from the graph above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want your half-life number to be very large which means you want to be as
  close to zero expenses as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2013/05/27/the-heavy-toll-of-investment-expenses/#3875f0443ebc&quot;&gt;According to Morningstar&lt;/a&gt;, in 2013 the “typical” managed fund of stocks has a expense of 1.2%.  Such a expense would eat up
  half of your gains in 57 years which seems like a long time.  But you would lose
  an eighth of your portfolio value in just 11 years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It gets even worse if you consider the “all-in” costs of actively managed funds.
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/sum/10.2469/faj.v70.n1.1&quot;&gt;John Bogle suggests&lt;/a&gt; that there are
  many unaccounted costs in an actively managed fund that can increase the actual
  “all-in” expense to something more like 2.21%.  The main unaccounted for costs are
  “transaction costs, cash drag, and sales loads”.  These extra costs are hard to
  quantify but they effectively can reduce your expected return beyond the published
  expenses.
  In any case, if you believe Bogle’s hypothesis, then an actively managed fund with
  a 2.2% expense has a half-life of only 31 years and a 7/8-life of just 6 years!
  That means that you could be losing as much as an eighth of your portfolio every
  6 years if you invest in actively-managed funds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contrast this with a leading low-cost index fund from Vanguard like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0585&amp;amp;FundIntExt=INT&quot;&gt;Total Stock Market Index&lt;/a&gt; fund (VTSAX)
  which has an expense ratio of 0.05%.  This expense would take 1385 years to lose half
  it’s value or 267 years to lose an eighth.  To put it another way, after 40 years
  an expense of 0.05% would only take 2.0% off of your portfolio value which is less
  than some funds would cost in a single year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, just about everybody knows that low-cost funds are a great way to invest and maximize
returns.
Putting these expenses in terms of how they eat away at your portfolio can be eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Super-Simple Virtual-Buffer Withdrawal Strategy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href=&quot;/the-30-30-withdrawal-strategy/&quot;&gt;30-30 Withdrawal Strategy&lt;/a&gt; is a
nice clean method for withdrawing money from your portfolio,
it does require you to keep track of a buffer which
drives the calculation for your withdrawal amount every year.
I felt like there should be a way to calculate the withdrawal in terms of only
your current withdrawal amount and your current portfolio value thus alleviating
the need to keep track of a separate spending buffer.
After playing with the math, it turns out there is a pretty simple formula
that achieves this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-bit-of-math&quot;&gt;A Bit of Math&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount that is initially spent from your portfolio is determined directly
by multiplying your withdrawal rate by your portfolio value.  Using the same
variables as the &lt;a href=&quot;/safe-withdrawal-rates-for-vampires/&quot;&gt;Safe Withdrawal Rates for Vampires&lt;/a&gt;
article,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;W = Pw
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;W = annual withdrawal amount
w = annual withdrawal rate
P = portfolio value
k = buffer size in years
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we have a buffer of &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; years, then the total buffer size initially
is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;initial buffer size = kW
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year of spending from the buffer, it is reduced by the withdrawal amount,
&lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt;.  So we are left with,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; buffer after 1 year of spending = kW-W = W(k-1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we add back an amount equal to the new portfolio value times the
withdrawal rate to arrive at the new buffer size,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; updated buffer value after 1 year = W(k-1) + Pw
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to compute the new withdrawal amount, we just divide this amount
by the size of the buffer in years (&lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new annual withdrawal amount = W(k-1)/k + Pw/k
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I prefer to think of my withdrawals as monthly, let’s rewrite this
in terms of monthly withdrawals,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new monthly withdrawal amount = (W/12)(k-1)/k + Pw/12k
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; are constant values, we now have a formula for computing
our new withdrawal amount from the current monthly withdrawal (&lt;code&gt;W/12&lt;/code&gt;),
and the current portfolio value (&lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-using-30-30-numbers&quot;&gt;Example Using 30-30 Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s put some numbers to this to make it less abstract.  Start with a
portfolio of &lt;code&gt;P = $720,000&lt;/code&gt; and go with the 30-30 Withdrawal Strategy numbers
for buffer size (&lt;code&gt;k = 2.5 years&lt;/code&gt;), and withdrawal rate (&lt;code&gt;w = 3.33%&lt;/code&gt;).
For these values, the initial monthly withdrawal is simply,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pw/12 = $720000*0.0333/12 = $2000/month
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can set aside your buffer of 2.5 years ($60,000) in a safe place.
But the beauty of this strategy is that you don’t have to do so.  You can also
just assume that your buffer is fully invested within the bond portion of your
portfolio; it’s up to you.  This is why I call it a “virtual” buffer because
you get the advantages the buffer gives you without having to keep track of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s assume a year has passed and it has been a good year and the portfolio
has gone up to $765,000.  Now your monthly withdrawal amount is computed as,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(W/12)(k-1)/k + Pw/12k = $2000(1.5/2.5) + $765000*.03333/(12*2.5))
                       = $2000 * 0.6 + $765000/900
                       = $1200 + $850
                       = $2050
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even though the portfolio increased by 6.25% (&lt;code&gt;765000/720000&lt;/code&gt;), the monthly
spending only went up 2.5% (&lt;code&gt;2050/2000&lt;/code&gt;) due to the virtual 2.5-year buffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, look how simple the calculation is every year.  In this example, multiplying
your current income by 0.6, divide your portfolio by 900, and add those 2 numbers
together.  Pretty simple right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-it-even-simpler&quot;&gt;Making it Even Simpler&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As easy as this calculation is, I couldn’t help but noticing that dividing by
900 is a little awkward.  What if we changed the buffer size so that we ended
up dividing by 1000?  If we can divide by 1000 then the calculation can almost
be done in your head.  To state this mathematically, we want,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;12k/w = 1000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the annual withdrawal rate is fixed, then we solve for the buffer size to get,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;k = 1000w/12
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substituting this back into our withdrawal equation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new monthly withdrawal amount = (W/12)(1-0.012/w) + P/1000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisiting the first example with a portfolio of $720,000 and a withdrawal
rate of 3.333%, the first year withdrawal is still $2000/monthly because the
withdrawal rate is the same.  After the first year with a new portfolio value
of $765,000, the new monthly withdrawal now becomes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(W/12)(1-0.012/w) + P/1000 = $2000(1-0.012/0.03333) + $765000/1000
                           = $2000 * 0.64 + $765000/1000
                           = $1280 + $765
                           = $2045
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you can see that the slightly modified equation only decreased the income by
$5/month.  This decrease is due to a slightly larger buffer (2.778 years vs 2.5 years)
which means that the market gyrations are smoothed a little more than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-super-simple-virtual-buffer-withdrawal-formula&quot;&gt;The Super-Simple Virtual-Buffer Withdrawal Formula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize all the above math, in the first year of withdrawals, you withdrawal
from your portfolio by simply multiplying your portfolio value by your withdrawal
rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;initial monthly withdrawal = Pw/12
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after each year you compute your new withdrawal amount with this
super-simple formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;new monthly withdrawal = M * beta + P/1000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;M = previous monthly withdrawal
beta = monthly withdrawal multiplier = 1 - 1.2%/w
w = annual withdrawal rate
P = current portfolio value
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph below shows the monthly withdrawal multiplier as a function of
annual withdrawal rate.  If you hover over the chart you will see other
information including a “Sample Allocation” which shows how you might need
to allocate more to stocks as your withdrawal rate goes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few possible portfolio types you could choose from depending on your
risk tolerance.  The Step-By-Step section that follows walks through a simple example
using the “moderate” strategy numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;annual withdrawal rate&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;conservative&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.40%&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.50 yrs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;moderately aggressive&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3.33%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;0.64&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.78 yrs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;aggressive&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4.00%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;0.7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3.33 yrs&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-by-step&quot;&gt;Step-By-Step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the Super-Simple Virtual-Buffer Withdrawal strategy is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compute your initial monthly withdrawal from the equation &lt;code&gt;Pw/12&lt;/code&gt;.
For example, with a $400,000 portfolio (&lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;) and a 3% withdrawal rate (&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;),
your monthly withdrawal is,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$400,000*0.03/12 = $1000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Withdrawal from the portfolio for a full year using the last computed value.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of each year, compute your new monthly withdrawal rate using
the equation &lt;code&gt;M * beta + P/1000&lt;/code&gt;.  For example,
with a 3% withdrawal rate (&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;), your beta multiplier is &lt;code&gt;1 - 1.2%/3% = 0.6&lt;/code&gt;.
If your portfolio (&lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;) has increased to $420,000 after the first year,
then your new withdrawal is,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$1000*0.6 + $420000/1000 = $600 + $420 = $1020&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go back to step 2 and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nerd-alert&quot;&gt;Nerd Alert&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some readers may have noticed that the formula for this withdrawal strategy
looks an awful lot like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing&quot;&gt;exponential smoothed average&lt;/a&gt;.
If we rewrite the withdrawal formula like this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;M(t) = (1-alpha) * M(t-1) + alpha * Pw/12
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;alpha = 1.2%/w
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then you can see that it is indeed an exponential moving average of the
term &lt;code&gt;Pw/12&lt;/code&gt;.  That term represents the annual withdrawal rate projected down
to the monthly level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For exponential smoothed averages, a smaller &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; represents an average that has
a larger smoothing effect.  In the case of this withdrawal strategy,
the smaller &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to larger withdrawal rates which means that larger
withdrawal rates will have larger smoothing effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parting-thoughts&quot;&gt;Parting Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein has been attributed with the saying that “everything should be made
as simple as possible, but not simpler”.  The super-simple virtual-buffer withdrawal
strategy is simple and requires no bookkeeping other than checking your portfolio
value once a year.  Is there a simpler strategy?  Yes, you could simply
take a constant value out without checking your portfolio balance.
But such a strategy could be risky since it ignores the possibility of a
declining portfolio balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The super-simple strategy also has flexibility which comes from the fact that
the buffer is “virtual”.  Whether or not you keep an actual buffer is up to you.
Generally it’s a good idea to keep a couple years or so of spending outside
of your investments so that you know it will be there when you need it.  But this
strategy doesn’t require you do so, it’s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Affordable Care Act May Increase Your Marginal Tax Rate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you retire before you are eligible for Medicare at age 65, then you
may find yourself buying health insurance through one of the Affordable Care Act
health exchanges.
Furthermore, if your taxable income falls below 4 times the
Federal Poverty Level (FPL), then you will qualify for a subsidy which
could pay for a nice chunk of your health insurance premium.
For 2016 the FPL is set at $11,770 for singles and $15,930 for couples, so
you could be eligible for a tax credit for incomes below $47,080 (single) or
$63,720 (couples).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with marginal tax rates?  It turns out that the
subsidy is a tax credit which gradually decreases as your taxable income increases.
For example, if your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magi.asp&quot;&gt;modified adjusted gross income&lt;/a&gt;
(MAGI) is between 3 and 4
times the FPL ($47,790 to $63,720 for couples), then your tax credit decreases
by 9.56% for every extra dollar earned.  And even though it’s a credit and not
a tax, the effect of a decreasing credit is mathematically equivalent to a
tax because the end result is that you will have 9.56% less money in your
pocket for every dollar of increased income.  Adding that to the
marginal tax rate means that your &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; marginal tax rate is higher
if you’re in the income range where you receive a health care premium subsidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not bad to receive the tax credit because that’s free money.
But it’s good to understand how this affects your tax rate so that you
can plan on how and when to take income from your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marginal-tax-rates&quot;&gt;Marginal Tax Rates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pay your taxes, then you’re probably already well aware of the tax brackets,
from 10% all the way up to 39.6% for the highest earners.  This article is
focused on the 10% and 15% brackets because that’s where the ACA
credits occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, I’m just going to consider the simple case of a married
couple using the standard deduction ($12,600 in 2016) and the the personal
exemptions ($4,050 in 2016) which means that the first $20,700 of adjusted
gross income is tax free.  The same issue applies to single filers, just at
a lower income level.  Here’s a graph of the marginal tax rates versus income
for joint filers in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;brackets&quot; class=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you itemize deductions, this graph will shift to the right by the amount
that your deductions exceed the standard deduction ($12,600).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marginal-effects-of-tax-credit-decreases&quot;&gt;Marginal Effects of Tax Credit Decreases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS publishes a table that is used to calculate how much to reduce your
ACA subsidy by comparing your income to the Federal Povery Level (FPL).
This table can be found in Table 2 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8962.pdf&quot;&gt;instructions for Form 8962&lt;/a&gt;
which lists incomes levels from 100% through 400%.  For a married couple,
the FPL is $15,930, so 100% to 400% of FPL corresponds to incomes between
$15,930 and $63,720.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the IRS table publishes different values for each FPL percentage point,
I have computed the marginal tax effect for every 1%  of FPL ($159) between 100%
and 400% FPL to come up with the following graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;acacredits&quot; class=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down this chart by income ranges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$15,930 - 21,187 (100-133% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - in the lower range the premium subsidy is
 reduced by the smallest amount, 2.01%.  But many people in this range would be eligible
 for Medicaid and may choose to not buy insurance and thus may not be affected at all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$21,187 (133% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - there is a spike at this income level because there’s
 a jump in the subsidy reduction from 2.01% to 3.02%.  So as your income increases
 from 132% to 133% of FPL, your subsidy goes down by &lt;code&gt;133*.0302-132*.0201&lt;/code&gt; =
 136% ($217 more taxes for $159 increase in income).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$21,187 - 47,790 (133-300% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - in this range the IRS table publishes an
 ever increasing subsidy reduction rate which translates to a gradually
 increasing marginal tax rate.  The jaggedness is due the rounding of the values
 in the IRS table.  The average effect on marginal tax rate across this range is
 &lt;code&gt;(300*.0956-133*.0302)/(300-133)&lt;/code&gt; = 14.8%.
 At it’s peak it approaches 18.5% for incomes right below 300% of FPL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$47,740 - 63,720 (300-400% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - this is the top range in which a subsidy
 is available and the reduction is a constant 9.56% across the entire range.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$63,720 (400% FPL)&lt;/strong&gt; - technically there could be a huge spike (cliff) at this
 income level because when you make $63,720, you lose all remaining premium
 credits.  There could also be no spike if you choose the cheapest health care
 plan, in which case your premium subsidy may have already been exhausted
 at this income level.  I chose not to show it on the graph because it’s not a
 constant percentage for all situations but it’s important to be aware of this
 premium cliff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, you will see an increase anywhere from 9.56% to as much as 18.5% in
your effective marginal tax rate due to the reduction of the premium tax credit.
The average increase across the whole range (133-400%) is 12.8%.  Since this
occurs in the 10-15% income tax ranges, this is a big jump in marginal tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;effective-marginal-tax-rate&quot;&gt;Effective Marginal Tax Rate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next graph simply combines the marginal tax rates with the effects of the
reduction in premium subsidies to come up with the &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; marginal tax rate.
It’s somewhat startling to see that the effective marginal tax rates can be higher
than those for people earning over $96,000 (603% FPL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;effective&quot; class=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we normally think of as the 10% tax bracket is now approximately a 25% tax
bracket.  The lower end of the 15% tax bracket (below $48,000) has become a 32%
tax bracket.  And between $48,000 and $64,000 the marginal tax rate is nearly 25%.
We finally return to the 15% tax rate above $64,000 but lose the premium subsidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;capital-gains&quot;&gt;Capital Gains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term capital gains are are similarly affected.  Instead of having zero
marginal tax rates up to the 25% bracket, there are now significant marginal
effects in the 133-400% FPL range.  And in the 250-300% FPL range you would be
at a higher marginal rate (&amp;gt; 15%) than people with much higher incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;capgains&quot; class=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategies&quot;&gt;Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of this increase in marginal tax rate has colored my views on
how and when to take income from my portfolio.  It mostly boils down to the
concept of delaying my taxable income until age 65 when Medicare
kicks in and I no longer am eligible for ACA credits.  Alternatively, either
Mrs. Moneycle or I could get a job with health benefits, but that requires
working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some things you can do to push income forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deplete taxable and Roth assets before touching IRA/401k funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perform tax-loss harvesting to capture losses now (taking gains after 65)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defer IRA to Roth conversions which produce taxable income&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move dividend-producing assets like bonds into IRAs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delay taking pensions and social security until after age 65&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When buying annuities, add a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)
  which gives you less income in the early years and more income later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use delayed income annuities which start at age 65 or beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If most of your investable assets are in tax-qualified accounts (IRA/401k),
then you may not be able to defer your taxable income as much.  In this case
I would recommend spreading your Roth and taxable asset withdrawals from now
until age 65 so that you can get a little benefit each year.  But you might
want to consider lumping those same assets over just a few years if it allows
you to push your income below 400% FPL and get a tax subsidy for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, if you are able to push income forward until age 65, you probably
want to take as much income as you can between ages 65 and 70 while staying
in the 15% tax bracket.  This is because at age 70, you will most likely begin
taking social security and also be required (at age 70.5) to take required minimum
distributions from your IRAs which all adds up to more taxable income.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the overall strategy is,
(1) take as little taxable income as possible while receiving ACA subsidies,
(2) take as much taxable income as possible while not receiving ACA subsidies, and
(3) make it to age 70 and thank your younger self for planning ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Top 5 Credit Cards</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;
  .card {
    width: 150px;
    float: left;
    margin: 0.4em 1.5em 0.8em 0em;
  }
  .card img {
    width: 150px;
  }
  .card p {
    margin: 0;
  }
  table {
    margin 0;
    padding: 0 1em 1em;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having recently returned from a big international travel trip, my interest in
“travel hacking” was piqued.  Is it really possible to travel on the cheap or free
using so-called “travel hacking” techniques?  After a fair bit of research,
my take on “travel hacking” is that it generally involves signing up for
credit cards that give generous signup bonuses of miles (or points) that can be used
to purchase flights and hotels.
The basic premise of “travel hacking” is continually signing up for new cards
(churning) while collecting those bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion about travel hacking is that I don’t have the patience or penchant for
churning through a bunch of credit cards to earn the signup bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;
I also question the ethics of some of the spending techniques and the possible
ill effects on my credit rating.
However, in the process of researching
the subject I discovered a few good credit cards that are good for people like
me who prefer holding credit cards for the long-term benefits.
So I thought I would share the results of that research with my reader(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of warning, these card recommendations are geared
towards people who pay off their cards every month.  If you carry a balance
then you should do your own research and look for a card with a low interest
rate and endeavor to pay it off as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-card-picking-philosophy&quot;&gt;My Card-Picking Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking I’m looking for cards that make my life simpler while
giving rewards for things that I already spend money on.  I don’t want to
have to jump through too many hoops or keep track of gimmicks.  Generally,
I prefer simple cash-back rewards that are automatically applied to my account
so that I don’t have to do anything special to get the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I shy away from cards that play games with rewards on constantly shifting
spending categories.  For example, some cards will give 5% cash-back in rotating
categories but you have to remember what the category is and you may have
to activate the category in order to receive the rewards.
I don’t want to be bothered with these sorts of shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also tend to bristle at the use of unnecessary fees.  Most of the cards
I recommend have zero annual fees, but you also have to look out for the
less obvious fees like foreign transaction fees if you travel abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-credit-card-comparison-sites&quot;&gt;Good Credit-Card Comparison Sites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of websites that will give you recommendations for their favorite
credit cards.  But I’ve found a couple that I particularly like that give you
more control of the comparison process.
Both of these sites allow you to set your spending levels in different categories
so that the recommendations are based on the savings and rewards that you might
actually receive with your current spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magnifymoney.com/compare/cashback-rewards&quot;&gt;MagnifyMoney&lt;/a&gt; is my
first choice because it seems to have
the most unbiased approach.  You put in your spending and it gives you a list
of cards ranked by overall savings.  The categories are:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;gas&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;travel&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;groceries&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;eating out&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;other&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdwallet.com/cash-rewards-credit-cards&quot;&gt;NerdWallet’s site&lt;/a&gt; is a little slicker than MagnifyMoney’s,
but it seems to be lacking the critical category of travel.  As such, I tend
to lump my travel estimates in with “dining” while using NerdWallet.  The categories supported by
NerdWallet are:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;gas&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;grocery/drug&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;dining&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;other&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to play with both sites using your own spending estimates.
But if you just want to see my top 5 recommendations, here they are (in
alphabetical order).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;american-express-blue-cash-preferred&quot;&gt;☞ American Express Blue Cash Preferred&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/blue-cash-preferred&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/amex_blue_preferred.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amex Blue Preferred&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6% groceries, 3% gas, 1% all other&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual Fee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$75&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Tx Fee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.7%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signup Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$150 after $1000 in 3 months&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t beat 6% back on any category and groceries is a category that many
people already use heavily.  Even if you’re not a big grocery buyer, you could use this
card to buy gift cards (Amazon, Target, Chipotle, etc) at your grocery store and
save that 6% at those other places you shop.  However, this reward category
is capped at $6000/year of purchases ($360 of cash-back).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest downside of this card is the $75 annual fee.  You would need to
spend at least &lt;code&gt;$75/.06 = $1250&lt;/code&gt; per year in groceries in order to recover the
annual fee.
And if you’re comparing this card to a card with no annual fee that rewards 2%
for groceries, then you need to spend at least &lt;code&gt;$75/(.06-.02) = $1875&lt;/code&gt; per year
($36/week) to match what you would get on the 2% rewards card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possible downside is how Amex defines grocery stores.  If you buy groceries
at a superstore like Target, Costco, Sam’s Club or Walmart, then Amex doesn’t
count those purchases towards the 6% reward.  They only count the “regular”
grocery stores such as Safeway, Albertsons, or King Soopers.
So be aware of that before you sign up for this card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another downside to this card is the 2.7% foreign transaction fee.  If you travel
out of the country you may want to leave this card at home, especially
since there are fewer places that accept Amex abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;barclaycard-arrival-world-mastercard&quot;&gt;☞ Barclaycard Arrival World MasterCard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findmybarclaycard.com/barclaycard-credit-cards/arrival-travel&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/barclay_arrival.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barclaycard Arrival World&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2x travel, 2x dining, 1x all other&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual Fee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Tx Fee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signup Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20,000 miles after $1000 in 3 months&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This card combines good rewards for travel and dining purchases with no annual
fees and no foreign transaction fees.  This makes it a good card to have in your
wallet for eating out both at home and abroad.  And with each point being worth
a penny towards travel redemptions, the $200 signup bonus is icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this card gives you back an additional 5% on redeemed miles.  For example,
if you redeem 10,000 miles, they plop an additional 500 miles back into your account.
Consider if you purchase $100 of travel, you immediately get back 200 miles worth
$2 which is a 2% reward.
And when you eventually redeem those 200 miles you will get 5% of those miles,
or 10 miles, added back to your account.  So effectively you get 210 miles (2.1%)
reward on travel and dining expenses.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s not a huge difference over 2%, but it’s something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature not often mentioned for this card is that you can assign a PIN to it.
This is useful for travel in places like Europe where Chip+PIN systems exist.
For example, if you are purchasing train tickets at a kiosk in Europe,
it may not accept a Chip+Signature card but a Chip+PIN card may work just fine.
Chip+PIN systems are more widely accepted in developed countries outside of the
United States so this could be a good backup card to have in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main downside of this card is that your rewards are applied only towards
travel purchases so you will have to wait until you have travel expenses before
you can cash in your rewards.  Fortunately you don’t have to pay for your entire
travel expense with the rewards, so you can use up whatever miles you have to
pay for just a portion of your travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t travel much and prefer cash
rewards, you might want to consider one of the cash-rewards cards first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1.5%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual Fee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Tx Fee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signup Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$100 after $500 in 3 months&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite rewards card that doesn’t have a foreign transaction fee or
an annual fee.
You still get a very good reward amount without having to pay any fees.
I like the no-nonsense approach of this card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very good card to keep in your wallet for international travel expenses
and is also a pretty good choice for every-day spending at home.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual Fee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Tx Fee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signup Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;none&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Citi Double cash reward is fairly unique in that it gives you a 1% reward
at the time of the transaction and another 1% reward when you pay down the balance.
Effectively this is a 2% cash-back reward but you get half of it now and half of
it later.  If you pay your balance every month then “later” is next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining that with the fact that the card doesn’t have an annual fee makes it a
good choice for your go-to card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main gripe with this card is that it has a 3% foreign transaction fee which
means you will want to leave it at home when you travel internationally.  But
for domestic spending it’s a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;none&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fidelity rewards card is a great option for people who already have an
account with Fidelity.  The rewards for this card can go directly to your Fidelity
account and be invested so it’s a nice way to do some “free” investing, which is
akin to cashing in your pocket change and investing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t have a Fidelity account, you can open one with zero balance
and tie it to this card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downsides of this card are the foreign transaction fee and the requirement
to have a Fidelity account.
The 1% foreign transaction fee is not too bad but zero would be better.  And opening
an account at Fidelity is not necessarily a show-stopper but it could be annoying
if you already have your investments with another firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall this is a solid card and it may be a good choice for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-1st-card-in-my-wallet&quot;&gt;The 1st Card in My Wallet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/quicksilver/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/capitalone_quicksilver.png&quot; alt=&quot;Capital One Quicksilver Cash&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to carry just 1 card in my wallet, it would need to be a card that is
widely accepted worldwide and still gives a decent reward for everyday expenditures.
Frankly, this eliminates the Amex cards because they just aren’t accepted at as many
places as VISA and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the first card in my wallet is the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards
card.  The no-nonsense approach to rewards (1.5%) and fees (0%) gives it a slight
edge in my book over the cards that give slightly higher rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner Up&lt;/strong&gt;: My second choice for my 1st card is the Fidelity Rewards Visa
card.  Its high rewards coming with low foreign transaction fee makes it a solid
backup.  I also like the idea that the rewards could contribute directly to
retirement savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-2nd-card-in-my-wallet&quot;&gt;The 2nd Card in My Wallet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/blue-cash-preferred&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/amex_blue_preferred.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amex Blue Preferred&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the first card in my wallet has no foreign transaction fees, I’m fine having
a card with big rewards that is mostly for domestic use.  My number 2 card is the
American Express Blue Cash Preferred card.  The huge 6% rewards for grocery expenses
is too hard to ignore and easily covers the annual fee for me.&lt;br /&gt;
Combining this with the fact that you can buy gift cards
for other merchants like Amazon, Target, Southwest Airlines, or just about any
major restaurant chain, means you can shift some of this reward to those categories
with the judicious use of gift cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner Up&lt;/strong&gt;: My second choice for my 2nd card is the Citi Double Cash card.
The Citi card would be a higher choice if it weren’t for the higher foreign transaction
fees and the reputation of the bank behind it.  But a no-annual fee card with
2% cash rewards is a great backup choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-3rd-card-in-my-wallet&quot;&gt;The 3rd Card in My Wallet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findmybarclaycard.com/barclaycard-credit-cards/arrival-travel&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/barclay_arrival.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barclaycard Arrival World&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 3rd card in my wallet, I would choose the Barclaycard Arrival World
MasterCard.
This card is a good option for traveling abroad with it’s zero foreign
transaction fees and high travel and dining rewards.  I also like the idea of
rounding out my 3 cards with one of each type (VISA, Amex, MasterCard), to make
sure I have maximal card coverage wherever I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runner Up&lt;/strong&gt;: My second choice for my 3rd card is, again, the Citi Double Cash card.
While they don’t explicitly say what type of card it is, I think most of the Citi
cards are MasterCards. So if this card is on the MasterCard network, this choice
would keep with the idea of rounding out my 3 cards with one of each type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parting-thoughts-and-a-little-math&quot;&gt;Parting Thoughts and a Little Math&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that, when doing your own analysis of credit card options, you need
to consider the opportunity cost of a new card compared to another card, and not
the absolute benefit.  For example, while a 6% benefit on groceries means
that you will earn $6 for every $100 spent, that’s not the only consideration.
You also need to consider how that reward compares to another card that
maybe has a smaller reward but also a smaller annual fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you are trying to decide if card_1 (higher reward) is better
than card_2 (lower annual fee), the following equation will determine the
spending threshold above which the card_1 with the higher reward is better
than the card with the lower annual fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;spending &amp;gt; (annual_fee_1 - annual_fee_2) / (reward_1 - reward_2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, comparing a card (Amex Blue Cash) with a 6% reward and $75 annual fee to
a card (Citi Double Cash) with a 2% reward and a $0 annual fee,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;spending &amp;gt; ($75-$0) / (.06-.02) = $1875&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the card with the higher reward will be able to overcome it’s
higher fee after $1875 worth of spending.  So even though $1250 worth of spending
would pay for the annual fee on the Amex card, it may not be worth getting that
card over the Citi card unless you are pretty sure you’ll spend at least $1875
in that reward category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But fees and rewards are not the only factors you should look at when considering
a new credit card.
Don’t forget to look at ancillary benefits such as insurance, Apple Pay,
consumer protection, fraud protection, and the company that stands behind the card.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>HSA Tax Advantages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This time of year has me thinking more about taxes than normal because I recently
took a first stab at income taxes for 2015.  While doing my taxes I noticed the
subject of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) coming up in a couple different places
so I thought I would share why HSAs can be an awesome place to invest your savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason that HSAs are great is the ability to pay for things with pre-tax
dollars.  Depending on your tax bracket, this can be a huge “investment”.  Consider
going to the doctor and spending $100 from an HSA with before-tax dollars.
If you had to use after-tax dollars for that same $100 expense, and you were in
the 25% tax bracket, you would need to earn $133.33 in order to have the $100 left
over to pay the doctor.  Or to look at it another way, by using an HSA
you avoided spending $33.33 before tax, which is $25 after tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put that mathematically, the money saved by using money
from an HSA instead of after-tax dollars is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;money_saved = (money_without_hsa - money_with_hsa)*(1-tax_rate)
money_without_hsa = invoice_amount/(1-tax_rate)
money_with_hsa = invoice_amount
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which reduces to,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;money_saved = invoice_amount*tax_rate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you know you are going to have X dollars in medical expenses, it behooves
you to have X dollars sitting in your HSA because you will save X dollars
multiplied by your marginal tax rate in after tax dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;common-hsa-uses&quot;&gt;Common HSA uses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common uses for HSAs are basic medial expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dentist - use your HSA card to pay for that cleaning or root canal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doctor - doctor bills could be has high as your deductible, so you probably
want to build your HSA up to the amount of your deductible to cover large
expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prescriptions - those Viagra pills are expensive!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vision - in addition to regular visits to the eye doctor, you can use HSA funds
to pay for eyeglasses and eye surgeries including laser surgeries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesser-known-hsa-uses&quot;&gt;Lesser Known HSA uses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to use HSA dollars that you may not have heard about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long-Term Care (LTC) premiums - there are limits, but LTC policy premiums
can be paid in part using HSA dollars.  The older you are, the more of your
premiums are allowed to be paid using HSA dollars.  For tax-year 2015 the
limits are as follows:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;40 years old and younger – $380&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;41–50 years old – $710&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;51–60 years old – $1,430&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;61–70 years old – $3,800&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;70 years old and older – $4,750&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medicare premiums - you can’t continue contributing to your HSA after you
hit medicare age (65).  But you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use your HSA funds to pay for supplemental
Medicare insurance such as Medicare Part B, D or Medicare Advantage.  This
is a good reason to contribute above and beyond your deductible level before
you hit age 65.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Construction expenses - as you get older, you may find you need to need to
make modifications to your house.  Construction expenses to accommodate
somebody with medical issues may be paid for using HSA funds.  Examples include
wheelchair ramps, hand rails, widening doorways, etc..&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vasectomy - pair your vasectomy operation with your Viagra prescription and
put the whole thing on your HSA debit card!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of other things you can use HSA funds for.  Check out
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf&quot;&gt;the IRS publication&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of investing, HSAs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments&quot;&gt;generally considered the 3rd priority&lt;/a&gt;
behind (1) getting your 401k match if you have it and (2) paying off credit cards.
Besides the advantages described above, HSAs also act like an IRA in that the
growth of funds inside the HSA are tax deferred.  While you can take the funds
out after age 65 and be taxed on them just like an IRA, it’s probably best to
leave your money in the HSA and continue using it to pay for medical expenses
until the HSA is drained.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vanguard Managed Payout Quacks Like a Buffered Withdrawal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1498&amp;amp;FundIntExt=INT&quot;&gt;Vanguard Managed Payout Fund&lt;/a&gt;
(VMP) is a fairly unique offering in the current landscape of mutual funds.
While some companies offer funds called “Income Replacement Funds”
which are designed to provide an income stream for a fixed period of years,
this Vanguard fund is the only fund that I know of that seeks to provide a
income stream indefinitely.  And the formula used to calculate this income
stream has similarities to the &lt;a href=&quot;/buffer-withdrawals-to-stabilize-income/&quot;&gt;buffered withdrawal strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vanguards-managed-payout-formula&quot;&gt;Vanguard’s Managed Payout Formula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula used to calculate monthly income for the VMP Fund can be
found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.vanguard.com/pub/Pdf/p1498.pdf&quot;&gt;the prospectus&lt;/a&gt;.
Here’s a screenshot of that formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vg-managed-payout-formula.png&quot; alt=&quot;managed payout formula&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left side of the equation, the thing that jumps out is that the income
is based on a 4% withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right hand side of the equation describes what value is being multiplied by 4%.
Since the overall formula represents the “Monthly distribution per share”,
we can estimate the monthly distribution dollar amount by multiplying
both sides by the number of shares owned.
This means our annual distribution is simply 4% of the average value
of the “hypothetical account” over the past 3 years.  By reading the prospectus,
the “hypothetical account” represents what the account balance would have been if
it had been held over the previous 3 years while receiving income according
to the above formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphically, the average of the hypothetical account is taken by averaging
the portfolio’s value each day over the past 3 years as illustrated below
(I was too lazy to fill in all days of each year so use your imagination).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vmp-daily-avg.png&quot; alt=&quot;daily average&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That average is then multiplied by 4% to determine the annual withdrawal amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this compare to what we do when we take buffered withdrawals from
a portfolio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buffered-withdrawal&quot;&gt;Buffered Withdrawal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea of a buffered withdrawal is that, once a year, you take a percentage
of your overall portfolio and move that into your spending buffer.  Then you
divide your spending buffer by your buffer size (in years) to arrive at your
income for the coming year.  This is illustrated for a 4-year buffer below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vmp-yearly-avg.png&quot; alt=&quot;yearly average&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the illustration, for the buffer calculation at the beginning of 2016,
the income would be approximately&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
income = withdrawal_rate * (V_2013 + V_2014 + V_2015 + V_2016) / 4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that this is 4 years instead of 3 because we are taking the 4 data points
at the beginning of each year.  This 4-year annual average would be closest in
value to the 3-year daily average that VMP uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;Comparison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between the VMP formula and the buffered
withdrawal formula is the averaging period.  The VMP formula averages the account
value daily whereas the buffered withdrawal averages once a year.
If those averages turn out to be the same then the equations will give the
same amount of income.
And intuitively, those averages will be pretty close to each other,
or at least “close enough” for the purposes of determining how much income to take.
The exception would be in years with sharp up or down turns, the daily average
could be a bit different than the annual average,
but I’m not sure that it would be qualitatively better.
In fact, an annual average will be “smoother” because it smooths out the effects
of sharp market turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think either method is hugely better than the other.  In both cases,
if the market is going up, the amount of income to be withdrawn in the next year
will go up at a related but smaller rate.  Likewise when the market goes down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it interesting that the Vanguard Managed Payout formula was pretty similar
in theory to the buffered withdrawal strategy.  Vanguard doesn’t call it a
buffered withdrawal but the effect is the same in that the effects of market swings
will be smoothed by averaging the account over recent valuations.  If you like
the idea of a 4-year buffer that withdrawals at a rate of 4% per year, then the
simplicity of the VMP fund might appeal to you.  But, if you would like more control
over your portfolio, buffer size and withdrawal rate, then you might prefer to follow
the withdrawal strategy outlined in the &lt;a href=&quot;/buffer-withdrawals-to-stabilize-income/&quot;&gt;Buffered Withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;
article.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 30-30 Withdrawal Strategy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Withdrawing funds from your portfolio can be tricky.  On the one hand,
you want to make sure you take enough income to support your expenses.  On the other hand,
you want make sure you don’t run out of money by taking too much.
Most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Withdrawal_strategies&quot;&gt;withdrawal strategies&lt;/a&gt; break down as either a constant dollar or constant percentage or a hybrid of the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constant-dollar withdrawal strategies tend to start with some amount, like 4%, and take that dollar amount
each year.  Optionally, the amount could be increased to account for inflation each year.
While these constant dollar strategies are a great tool for academia to study the effects of different rates,
they have the possibility of failure (running out of money) if you continue to withdraw the same
amount of money without regard for what your portfolio is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constant-percentage withdrawal strategies get rid of the possibility of failure
by just taking a fixed percentage out of the portfolio every year,
regardless of what the market does.  This is an improvement over
constant dollar strategies because you can’t run out of money,
but it does mean that your income will be subject to the vagaries of the market.
If you can stomach those swings or have other sources of income to buffer
those swings, then this strategy might work fine for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “30-30 Withdrawal Strategy” described by this article has the advantages of a
constant-percentage strategy but attempts to buffer the market variations by using
shock-absorbing buffer.  The name of the strategy comes from the withdrawal rate and buffer size.
The basic idea of this strategy is that you move a fixed percentage of your portfolio (1/30) into
a spending buffer each year, then you take a fixed amount from that buffer (1/30)
for monthly living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/withdrawal-30-30.png&quot; alt=&quot;30-30 Withdrawals&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;withdrawal-rate-of-130&quot;&gt;Withdrawal Rate of 1/30&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “30-30 Withdrawal Strategy” uses a withdrawal rate of 3.33% for a couple of reasons.
First, it’s easy to remember.  Second and more importantly, it’s in the realm of
withdrawal rates that should, over time, allow you to keep up with inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does the 3.33% come from?  Recall from the &lt;a href=&quot;/safe-withdrawal-rates-for-vampires/&quot;&gt;Safe Withdrawal Rates for Vampires&lt;/a&gt; article that the safe withdrawal
rate for someone who needs their money to last forever is given by the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
withdrawal_rate &amp;lt;= (appreciation - inflation) / (1 + appreciation)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to know what future portfolio appreciation will be, but historically
a 50/50 stock/bond portfolio would have returned around 7-8%.  But when it comes to
retirement, I prefer to be a little more conservative.  So let’s chop about 2% off of 7.5%
to get a conservative future appreciation estimate of 5.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation is also a little tricky.  Currently inflation is running &lt;a href=&quot;http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/CurrentInflation.asp&quot;&gt;close to zero&lt;/a&gt; but
the Fed has said that they are aiming to keep it close to 2%.  So, for the sake
of this calculation, let’s assume the Fed is able to keep inflation near 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plugging those numbers into the above equation, we get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
withdrawal_rate &amp;lt;= (0.055 - 0.02) / (1 + 0.055) = 3.32%
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This withdrawal rate is also very close to 1/30 which means that you can just
divide your entire portfolio value by 30 to arrive at the amount needed for
an annual withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may disagree with the assumptions or have a different type of investment portfolio
with different return assumptions.  But understanding how I arrived at the
number may allow you to choose your own number for the withdrawal rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;month-buffer&quot;&gt;30-month Buffer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffering the annual withdrawals will help to smooth out the bumps in the portfolio
returns.  The idea of the buffer is that, each year, you take your annual withdrawal and immediately
put that into your income buffer.  Then you divide that income buffer by the size
of the buffer in months to arrive at your income level for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a 30-month buffer is frankly, somewhat arbitrary.  I chose 30 months (2.5 years)
partly because it has the number 30 in it, but also because I personally want to keep
the buffer relatively small so that I can keep as much of my portfolio invested as
possible. As with the withdrawal rate, you can use a buffer size of your choosing.
The bigger the buffer is, the smoother your income variations will be, but a bigger
buffer also means that less of your money is invested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-by-step&quot;&gt;Step-by-Step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go through an example portfolio to see how this works.  First, let’s start
with a portfolio of $900,000 (it divides by 30 nicely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create your initial spending buffer by dividing your portfolio by 30
  then multiplying by 2.5.  This represents 2.5 years worth of future spending so
  put it in a safe place like an interest-bearing account, short-term bonds, money-market,
  or similar.  For the example $900,000 portfolio, $900,000/30 = $30,000 so you would
  put $75,000 into your initial buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Divide your buffer balance by 30 to get your monthly income level and set up an
  automatic withdrawal of that amount that goes into your spending/checking account.
  In our example, $75,000/30 = $2500/month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Live off of the income for 12 months.  After 12 months your buffer should
  have approximately $45,000 left in it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of each year, recompute your portfolio value and move 1/30 of it
  into your buffer.  In our example, let’s assume that the invested portion
  of $825,000 increased to $885,000.  Add that to the remaining buffer ($45,000)
  to get your new portfolio value of $930,000.  Divide that by 30 and move that
  amount into your spending buffer.  $930,000/30 = $31,000.  Your spending buffer
  should now have $76,000.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go back to Step 2 and repeat annually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that I am including the buffer as part of the overall portfolio
value when doing the above calculations.  If you prefer to keep it separate from
the investment portfolio, then you could use a divisor of 27.5 (instead of 30)
on just the investment portfolio to achieve similar results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astute readers might notice that, even though the investment portfolio increased
by (885/825) 7.3%, the income in the next year will only rise by (76000/75000) 1.33%
which is below our assumed inflation rate of 2%.
This is because the initial buffer was created without taking inflation into account.
Over time this effect should go away and the average increases will keep pace with inflation.
If you want to take that into account from the get-go, you could create a smaller
initial buffer (e.g. 2.4x) which means you would receive less income initially.
But, I personally prefer to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; with a slightly larger income and suffer
the smaller initial income adjustment until the buffering “catches up”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variation-different-withdrawal-rates&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variation:&lt;/em&gt; Different Withdrawal Rates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The withdrawal rate of 3.33% was chosen with a fair amount of hand-waving but represents
what I would consider to be a fairly safe rate that has a reasonable chance of keeping up
with inflation.  However, if you’re a risk taker and/or have other streams of income to
buffer your income, then higher rates aren’t unreasonable.  For example, if you are
comfortable with a 4% withdrawal, then you could use 25 as your divisor instead of 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, maybe you could start with 30 then decrease it until you settle in on
a number that seems to suit you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;variation-different-buffer-sizes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variation:&lt;/em&gt; Different Buffer Sizes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 2.5 years is a handy size for the “30-30 Strategy”, it’s certainly not written in stone.
For example a 6-year strategy might play well into a Roth ladder if so you might choose to create
a buffer of 72 months.  Bigger buffers also have the advantage of smoothing out the
investment returns even more and giving you a more predictable income stream.  But the downside
of larger buffers is removing money from your investment pool so you might want to consider investing part
of a larger buffer into a medium-term bond fund or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “30-30 Withdrawal Strategy” is an easy mechanism for taking income from a portfolio.
Divide your portfolio by 30 to figure out much to put into your spending buffer.
Then divide the spending buffer by 30 to figure out how much to withdraw as income every month.
Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two Types of Income</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been noticing that every income stream follows one of two basic patterns.
It is either an indefinite stream that will go as long as you live, or it is
a finite stream that will end at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, income streams either start now, or in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about income in these terms it helps to give you a mental
framework when trying to structure your portfolio
to give you the income you need, when you need it.  For example, if you will have
an indefinite income stream (like a pension) that starts in the future,
then you may want to create some other income stream now that will last until that
future date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;indefinite-income-streams&quot;&gt;Indefinite Income Streams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indefinite income streams are those that are expected to last as long as you
and your spouse are alive.  The most common examples of this type of income are
as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Security&lt;/strong&gt; - It will still be there when you need it.  Ignore those
 who say otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pensions&lt;/strong&gt; - Pensions from a company you worked at tend to kick in at your
 retirement (or when you reach a particular age).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annuities&lt;/strong&gt; - You can buy an annuity from an insurance company that will give
 you income for as long as you live.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systematic Withdrawals&lt;/strong&gt; - If you withdraw funds from your portfolio at a prudent
  rate (3-4%) then there is a pretty good chance that it will last last long as you do.
  The only question is whether or not it will keep pace with inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finite-income-streams&quot;&gt;Finite Income Streams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finite income streams are those that you expect to end at some point.  Here are
some examples of those:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Job&lt;/strong&gt; - This is the quintessential finite income stream.  You can’t work
  forever.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridge Fund&lt;/strong&gt; - See my article on &lt;a href=&quot;./building-a-bridge-to-social-security&quot;&gt;creating a bridge to social security&lt;/a&gt;
 for an example of how to use funds to bridge to a future date.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income Replacement Funds&lt;/strong&gt; - Fidelity offers a particular type of fund called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://moneyover55.about.com/od/investmentincome/a/incomereplacement.htm&quot;&gt;Income Replacement Funds&lt;/a&gt;
that are designed to provide income until some future date.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonds&lt;/strong&gt; - You could buy a portfolio of bonds that return the principal in different
years and spend that money as it is returned to you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lending Money&lt;/strong&gt; - You can lend funds to somebody with the promise that they
 will pay it back with some agreed-upon rate.  Micro-lending companies like Lending
 Club and Prosper are a good way to do this efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imprudent Systematic Withdrawals&lt;/strong&gt; - if you draw down your portfolio too quickly,
 you could deplete it in a finite period of time.  Don’t do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;income-start-dates&quot;&gt;Income Start Dates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the duration of an income stream, you need to consider when they
income starts.  For example, if you are retiring at age 62, you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; start taking your
Social Security right at age 62.  However, it is often beneficial for you to delay
taking your benefits until age 70.  In that scenario, you would need to figure out
how to get an income stream that lasts 8 years until your social security kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, your goal as a retiree is to arrange these blocks of income to give you
an income stream that lasts indefinitely but is relatively smooth.  I like to think
of it using building blocks.  Here’s a crude drawing of what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                                   +-----------------------------&amp;gt;
                                   | Longevity Annuity (age 80)
+----------------+-----------------+-----------------------------&amp;gt;
|  Bridge Fund   |          Pension (age 65)
+----------------+----------+------------------------------------&amp;gt;
|  Income Replacement Fund  | Social Security (age 70)
+---------------------------+------------------------------------&amp;gt;
|  Systematic Withdrawals of remaining portfolio
+----------------------------------------------------------------&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this drawing, time goes from left to right.
This example depicts having a relatively steady stream of income until age 80
at which point your income is boosted by a longevity annuity.
The “Longevity Annuity” is one income stream you might want to purchase if you
anticipate needing extra future income to help with age-related expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in this example, I am also showing a couple of different finite income stream types being
used to bridge forward to indefinite income streams (pension and social security)
in the future.  The type of bridge isn’t important, I’m just trying to illustrate
the concept of bridging forward to that indefinite future income stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article doesn’t introduce much in the way of new concepts.  But I have found
it useful in structuring my own portfolio to think of income streams as one of two
basic types that can be combined like building blocks to give you the income you
need in retirement.  Hopefully this framework will help you too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Comparing Target-Date Fund Glide Paths</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Target-date funds are relative newcomers in the investment world.  Most of today’s
target-date funds were created in the last 10 years or so.  Their popularity has
grown largely since the passage in 2006 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Protection_Act_of_2006&quot;&gt;Pension Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pension Protection Act stipulates that employers provide what are called
“Qualified Default Investment Alternatives” which is a fancy way of saying that
they need to provide default investment alternatives that don’t suck.
And target-date funds are generally considered to not suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;typical-target-date-fund&quot;&gt;Typical Target-Date Fund&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general idea of the target-date fund is to invest for growth when the investor
is young and gradually decrease the amount of risky investments as the investor
approaches retirement age.  Typically the risky investment takes the form of
stocks and the safer investment is in bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from the early growth period to the later safe period is called
the “glide-path”.  In visual form, here’s what a typical glide path looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot shows the glide-path continuing to decrease a little past the retirement
age. This is fairly common and is often referred to as a “glide-through” fund
versus a fund that stops chaning right at the target-date which is called a “glide-to”
fund.  It’s good to understand these differences so that you aren’t surprised to
find that your fund is still changing allocation after the target-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, I was focused on some of the
more popular target-date funds.  Defining popularity is tricky so I chose to just
consider the biggest and cheapest funds.  “Biggest” funds are defined by their
assets under management, and “cheapest” funds are defined by their expense ratios.
The data for this article came mostly from a comprehensive article published by
Morningstar titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://corporate1.morningstar.com/ResearchArticle.aspx?documentId=705998&quot;&gt;“2015 Target-Date Fund Landscape”&lt;/a&gt;, and was verified by looking
at the individual mutual-fund companies’ websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;biggest-target-date-funds&quot;&gt;Biggest Target-Date Funds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table lists the 4 biggest target-date funds in terms of total market share:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table id=&quot;funds-by-share&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Fund Family&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;2014 Market Share (%)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Expense Ratio (%)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody /&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four funds make up wholly two thirds of all target-date funds so they are the gorillas.
Vanguard is the clear market share leader with over a quarter of the entire target-date fund market.
But Fidelity has a couple of entries that add up to over 20% of the market.  From what I’ve been
able to glean, Fidelity’s “K” series of funds is similar to the non-K series except
that it is only available to 401k plans run by Fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cheapest-target-date-funds&quot;&gt;Cheapest Target-Date Funds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are the 4 funds with the smallest expense ratios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table id=&quot;funds-by-expense&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Fund Family&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;2014 Market Share (%)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Expense Ratio (%)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody /&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the low-cost leader Vanguard is also on this list.
But the “Fidelity Freedom Index” fund has a slight edge on expense.
Note that the “Fidelity Freedom Index” is yet another target-date fund
from Fidelity.  The “Index” variant from Fidelity appears to be their low-cost variant
composed of only low-cost Fidelity index funds.  The “Index” variant is also only
available via certain employer-sponsored plans which is why you can’t easily
find information about them on their public website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;glide-paths&quot;&gt;Glide Paths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the glide paths for all of the funds mentioned above&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  The zero point
on the time axis represents the relative target date.  For example, the point
-10 for a 2040 fund maps to the year 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
    &lt;svg&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these 7 funds, only BlackRock is the only “glide-to” fund that stops changing its
allocation right at the target date.  BlackRock is also unique in that its equity
percentage contains a fair amount of real-estate (REIT) investments (15% early on,
dwindling to near 0% at the end of the glide path).
I decided to lump the REIT into the “equity” bucket for this graph
but some would argue that you should put a portion of it into the “bond” bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All funds except BlackRock start at 90% equities.  If I had allocated 1/3 of the REIT
to equities then BlackRock would also have close to a 90% equity position at the
beginning too so consider that when looking at the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most funds have finished their glide paths within 7 years but T. Rowe Price continues
the glide down for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-thoughts&quot;&gt;General Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plotting the different glide paths is an interesting exercise and tool for comparing
funds to see which one most closely aligns with your goals.  But you don’t have to
pick the fund that matches your exact retirement date.  For example, if you want
the glide path to stop right at your retirement date and you like Vanguard,
then you might want to pick the Vanguard fund that is your retirement date minus
7 years to line that up with your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that most of these funds end at a very “safe” level of equities, perhaps too
safe for my tastes, but maybe just right for you.  I suspect that the fund companies
err on the side of being too conservative to avoid controversy.
As such, my preference would be to use a target date fund mostly during your
accumulation years then switch to a balanced fund (or set of funds) that match
your long-term risk tolerance when you are near your target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing, a big thing, that these funds can’t account for is how much money
you have in a pension or social security.  For example, if your social security
will cover 50% of your future spending, do you really need the rest of your
portfolio to glide to a 30% equity level?  You may conclude that you can take
more risk in your portfolio when social security has your back.
In the end, it comes down to your personal situation and your comfort level with risk.&lt;/p&gt;
