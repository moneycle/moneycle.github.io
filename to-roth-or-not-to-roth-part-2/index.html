    <h1 class="post-title">To Roth or Not to Roth? - Part 2, Reframing the Question</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Apr 6, 2017</p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-abstract">
    In Part 1, I discussed a hypothetical construct for figuring out how much to contribute to a Roth that was more academic than practical. In this article, instead of looking at how much to put into a Roth, I want to reframe the discussion as one of determining the maximum amount you should put into a Traditional account.

  </div>

  <article class="post-content">
    <img class="post-image" src="/images/shakespeare.png"/>
    <p>Many articles are written about the virtues of the Roth account<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
or the Traditional account types, but it’s rare to find an article suggesting
why you should probably consider having both types.</p>

<p>In this article I try to show that both types have their place, but the
important thing is to understand the main concept that will help you to determine
how much of each type you should have.  In short, the thesis of this
article is that you should first determine the maximum amount to
contribute to your Traditional account, then you should allocate the remainder
of your qualified savings to your Roth account.</p>

<h2 id="basics---tax-efficiency">Basics - Tax Efficiency</h2>

<p>The core decision of choosing Roth vs Traditional comes down to your tax rate
now (when you save the funds) versus your tax rate in the future (when you
withdraw the funds).  If your tax rates are identical now
and in the future you should choose the Roth because it has more flexibility
(access to principal, no distribution requirements).
But if your tax rates in the future, at the time of withdrawal, are lower than
your current marginal tax rate, then you could save money by deferring those
taxes into the future.</p>

<p>If you’re a good saver, then there’s a pretty good chance that you should
be using both Roth and Traditional.  Why?  Because there’s a very real
possibility that your Traditional savings will outgrow the lower tax brackets,
especially when you consider other future income sources.</p>

<h2 id="filling-future-tax-brackets">Filling Future Tax Brackets</h2>

<p>Think about your tax brackets over time.  For example, in an over-simplified
view of the world (ignoring inflation and other adjustments), your tax brackets
might look like this.</p>

<p><img src="/images/roth_or_not_2-brackets.png" alt="Tax Brackets Over Time" /></p>

<p>Granted this is a naive view of tax brackets (they actually do change over time),
but I’m just trying to make a point so ignore those details for the moment.</p>

<p>The general idea of saving to a Traditional account is that in the future you
will take those withdrawals out in lower tax brackets.  I like to visualize this
as pouring those Traditional IRA funds into the lower tax brackets over the time
that spans all of your retirement years.
For example, the following picture shows IRA funds filling up the 0% tax bracket
from retirement forward, which would be appropriate for anybody in a tax bracket
above 0% (probably everybody reading this).</p>

<p><img src="/images/roth_or_not_2-filling_0.png" alt="Filling 0% Tax Bracket" /></p>

<p>The idea of the above picture can be extended to higher tax brackets.  For example,
if you’re in the 33% tax bracket now, any savings you put into a Traditional IRA
now could save you money in the future if they were poured into any tax
bracket below 33% over the course of your retirement.</p>

<p>You might be thinking that the growth on the assets matter, but for this decision
it really doesn’t.  That’s because taking a percentage out now and letting your
investment grow (Roth) is mathematically equivalent to letting your entire
investment grow and taking the same percentage out later (Traditional).  So it
just comes down to figuring out when the tax rates will be lower.</p>

<p>The trick then is to figure out how big your Traditional account savings bucket
can get before it starts to leak into your current tax bracket in the future.
Because if you’re going to fill in your future tax brackets at your current
(or higher) rates, then you might as well contribute to a Roth.</p>

<h2 id="upper-bounds-for-traditional-accounts">Upper Bounds for Traditional Accounts</h2>

<p>So instead of determining what <em>percentage</em> to put in a Roth, the problem
becomes one of figuring out the maximum <em>absolute</em> amount to put into a
Traditional account.</p>

<p>We can approach this problem by putting an upper bound on the size of
the Traditional IRA bucket (in the picture).  Once you know what that
upper bound is, you can
project the maximum that your Traditional contributions should be in order
to fill that bucket by your retirement date.
The projection will never be an exact number because returns are unpredictable
and retirement dates change.  But if you have this framework in place,
then you can make minor adjustments every year to account for the shifts in
your portfolio balance and retirement date.</p>

<h2 id="other-income-sources">Other Income Sources</h2>

<p>Probably one of the hardest variables to predict ahead of time is the amount
of money you might get from other income sources.  Social Security is one
source that is fairly predictable, but what about income interest, dividends,
side-job income, pensions, inherited IRAs, annuities, et cetera.
You may have a good handle on what those sources are now, but it’s
not always easy to predict all future income sources.</p>

<p><img src="/images/roth_or_not_2-other_income.png" alt="Filling 0% Tax Bracket" /></p>

<p>The effect of future income sources is that they fill in your lower tax
brackets <strong>before</strong> withdrawals from your Traditional accounts.  This means
that you might have less room to withdraw funds in those lower tax brackets
in the future.  So the more future income you have from other sources, the
less you should contribute to Traditional accounts now.</p>

<h2 id="realistic-tax-brackets">Realistic Tax Brackets</h2>

<p>To determine the maximum Traditional contributions, we also should consider
a more realistic view of tax brackets in retirement.  If you’ve read previous
articles on this blog you may be familiar with the effects of taxes of a couple
life situations.  There are 3 general bands that can effect tax brackets as
show below.  The picture below does not represent every situation but is meant
to suggest how complicated it can get (your situation will be different).</p>

<p><img src="/images/roth_or_not_2-3_bands.png" alt="3 Tax-Bracket Bands" /></p>

<p>If you are getting health care from the ACA before age 65 then you would fall
into the band I’m calling the “ACA years”.
Those people eligible to receive Affordable Care Act premium credits may see
their <a href="/affordable-care-act-may-increase-your-marginal-tax-rate/">tax brackets jumbled up</a>
by those credits before they start taking medicare at age 65.
And this situation could very well change by the time you read this given
the current political climate.</p>

<p>The second band, which I call the “early medicare years”, is the time before
age 70 and after age 65.  This band has a fairly “normal” tax bracket signature
because it is not affected by ACA or Social Security effects on taxes.</p>

<p>Taking social security can effect the tax brackets at the lower end of the
income spectrum.  As discussed in a <a href="/how-social-security-messes-with-your-tax-brackets/">previous article on this blog</a>
these effects can have significant impacts to tax brackets at or below 25%.
Also, since most people should probably delay taking social security until age
70 (your situation may vary), we will consider the case of retiring at age 70
while taking social security in the next article in this series in this band
which I call the “Social Security years”.</p>

<h2 id="coming-next">Coming Next</h2>

<p>The next articles in this series will attempt to address the different bands of
time and how they might inform how much to save in Traditional accounts.
Ultimately the goal is to give you the tools (and maybe a calculator) to
estimate how much to contribute to Traditional accounts every year going
forward until you exit the rat race.</p>
