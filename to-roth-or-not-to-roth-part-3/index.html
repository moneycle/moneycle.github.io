<p>Age 70 is the focal point of this analysis because it’s the age (technically 70.5)
where you must begin taking distributions from your Traditional accounts.  It’s
also the latest age you can delay taking social security (and for many people
it is also the optimal age).</p>

<picture>

In order to figure out the maximum Traditional portfolio value at age 70,
we need to figure out what portfolio value will generate the amount of income
that fills in the lower tax brackets during retirement.
Combining that future income level with
the minimum withdrawal rate will allow us to calculate what the portfolio size
needs to be at age 70.
For example, the picture above depicts the case of filling in the tax brackets
below 15%, which would be the goal if your Traditional IRA contributions were
deducted from earnings in the 15% tax bracket.

There are multiple ways to generate income from a portfolio.  But if you
chose to do withdrawals, the IRS dictates what the required minimum distribution
(RMD) that must be taken so let's use that because it will put a lower limit
on the income (and an upper limit on portfolio size).  
The RMD for age 70 is 27.4 which corresponds to a withdrawal rate of 3.65%.

Using the numbers from the picture, if you want to keep your income below $39k,
then multiply that income by 27.4 to determine the target portfolio value for
age 70.  That means that you want your Traditional IRA portfolio to be less
than or equal to $1,069k when you hit age 70.  That million dollar goal seems
like a lot (and it is!) but it's very much within reach over a long-term
investing horizon.

So, if you currently are 50 years old, you want to project your
investment 20 years so that you hit that portfolio target at age 70,
in today's dollars, when you are 70 years old.
Doing the calculations in today's dollars is
a little easier so use an inflation-adjusted estimate of your portfolio returns
to project how much you will need in today's dollar.  For example, if you project
a return of 7% and inflation of 3% over the next 20 years, then the inflation-adjusted
return is 4%.  That means that in today's dollars the portfolio value would be,

    portfolio_today = $1069k / (1.04)^20 = $488k

In other words, $488k today could grow to $1069k in today's dollars over
the next 20 years.  So if you are 50 and already have $488k in your portfolio now,
then it would generate around $39k (in today's dollars) when you are 70 years
old.

More generally, the equation to figure out how much money you need in today's
dollars to reach a particular income stream at age 70 is,

    portfolio_needed_today = income_70 * 27.4 / (1+return-inflation)^(70-current_age)

## Contributions until age 70

The above equation is a conservative estimate of how big your portfolio needs
to be to generate a particular income when you're 70 years old.  But the more
interesting question to ask is "how much do you need to contribute to your
current portfolio to achieve that income level?".  The answer to that question
may also inform the decision of how much you should be putting into your
Traditional IRA going forward.

Since we are translating the portfolio values to today's dollars, let's
calculate the contributions needed in terms of the portfolio's actual current
value.

    portfolio_shortfall = (portfolio_needed_today - portfolio_actual_today)

Simply put, we need an annual contribution that is big enough to fill
that shortfall,

    contribution_needed = PV(rate-inflation, 70-current_age, portfolio_shortfall)

The equation for this present value calculation represents what level of
regular contribution is needed to equal the present value of `portfolio_shortfall`.

    contribution_needed =
      portfolio_shortfall * net_rate / (1 - (1+net_rate)^(current_age-70))

where,

    net_rate = rate-inflation

## 50-year old

Let's go back to the previous example.  Let's say you are 50 years old and
calculate that you will need $488k in today's dollars.  If you have nothing
saved, then your shortfall is the total amount of $488k.  Using an estimated
return of 7% with inflation at 3%,

    contribution_needed = $488k * .04 / (1-1.04^-20)
                        = $35.9k

Or almost $36k/year, into your Traditional 401k/IRA.  But if you have already
saved $244k (half of the needed amount), then you should contribute up to
$18k/year to your Traditional account, and contributions *above* $18k should
go to your Roth accounts in this hypothetical example.

## 25-year old, no savings

What about somebody who is just starting to save at age 25?  
How much should they save?
The big variable in this question will be what their future tax brackets will
look like which could change a lot in 45 years.  Just so that we can compare to
the 50-year old who starts saving later in life, let's assuming the same target
of $39k/year in today's dollars.  That would suggest a 'shortfall' of,

    $39k * 27.4 / (1.04)^45 = $183k

Which would suggest contributions of

    contribution_needed = $183k * .04 / (1-1.04^-45)
                        = $8,832

This shows the value of starting early.  Saving about $9k/year from age 25 until age 70
generates about the same future income as saving about $36k/year starting at age 50.

But it also suggests that when you start saving from a younger age, then you
might want to switch over from Traditional to Roth contributions at a lower cutoff.
