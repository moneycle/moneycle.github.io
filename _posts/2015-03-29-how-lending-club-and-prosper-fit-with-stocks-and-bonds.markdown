Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending could be thought of as another asset class for
your portfolio.  This article from LendingMemo suggests it's somewhere between
stocks and bonds.
Since it is still a nascent type of investment, the jury is out on how it will
perform in different kinds of markets.  I think it has great promise
as a part of your portfolio, however I wouldn't go up to 20% as suggested
by the article unless you have a higher tolerance for risk.
