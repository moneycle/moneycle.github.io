The top hat, monocle and mustachio have come to symbolize rich fat cats with lots of
money.  That image inspired the name of this blog, where we don the **money monocle**
to look into matters of money, retirement and proper attire[^1].
Hence comes the name, **moneycle**.

## Who Am I

I'm a geek from Denver, Colorado -- a geek by trade and by nature.
I enjoy the thinking about the math of investing.  I enjoy figuring out ways
to put money to work so I don't have to. And I enjoy sharing my thoughts so that,
hopefully, we can help *you* figure out how to retire early too.

Because of my geeky inclinations, this blog is hosted on github pages and you are free
to check out the source [on github](https://github.com/moneycle/moneycle.github.io).
But you don't have to be a geek to appreciate this blog.  While some posts may
end up being a bit more technical than others, my ultimate goal is to be
approachable by anyone who is interested in matters of money and retirement.

So please, read, learn and discuss.  Together we can make the world a more
retired place, one monocle at at time.
