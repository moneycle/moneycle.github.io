<p>Having recently returned from a big international travel trip, my interest in
“travel hacking” was piqued.  Is it really possible to travel on the cheap or free
using so-called “travel hacking” techniques?  After a fair bit of research,
my take on “travel hacking” is that it generally involves signing up for
credit cards that give generous signup bonuses of miles (or points) that can be used
to purchase flights and hotels.
The basic premise of “travel hacking” is continually signing up for new cards
(churning) while collecting those bonuses.</p>

<p>My conclusion about travel hacking is that I don’t have the patience or penchant for
churning through a bunch of credit cards to earn the signup bonuses.<br />
I also question the ethics of some of the spending techniques and the possible
ill effects on my credit rating.
However, in the process of researching
the subject I discovered a few good credit cards that are good for people like
me who prefer holding credit cards for the long-term benefits.
So I thought I would share the results of that research with my reader(s).</p>

<p>A word of warning, these card recommendations are geared
towards people who pay off their cards every month.  If you carry a balance
then you should do your own research and look for a card with a low interest
rate and endeavor to pay it off as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="my-card-picking-philosophy">My Card-Picking Philosophy</h2>

<p>Generally speaking I’m looking for cards that make my life simpler while
giving rewards for things that I already spend money on.  I don’t want to
have to jump through too many hoops or keep track of gimmicks.  Generally,
I prefer simple cash-back rewards that are automatically applied to my account
so that I don’t have to do anything special to get the rewards.</p>

<p>As such, I shy away from cards that play games with rewards on constantly shifting
spending categories.  For example, some cards will give 5% cash-back in rotating
categories but you have to remember what the category is and you may have
to activate the category in order to receive the rewards.
I don’t want to be bothered with these sorts of shenanigans.</p>

<p>I also tend to bristle at the use of unnecessary fees.  Most of the cards
I recommend have zero annual fees, but you also have to look out for the
less obvious fees like foreign transaction fees if you travel abroad.</p>

<h2 id="good-credit-card-comparison-sites">Good Credit-Card Comparison Sites</h2>

<p>There are lots of websites that will give you recommendations for their favorite
credit cards.  But I’ve found a couple that I particularly like that give you
more control of the comparison process.
Both of these sites allow you to set your spending levels in different categories
so that the recommendations are based on the savings and rewards that you might
actually receive with your current spending.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.magnifymoney.com/compare/cashback-rewards">MagnifyMoney</a> is my
first choice because it seems to have
the most unbiased approach.  You put in your spending and it gives you a list
of cards ranked by overall savings.  The categories are:
    <ul>
      <li>gas</li>
      <li>travel</li>
      <li>groceries</li>
      <li>eating out</li>
      <li>other</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/cash-rewards-credit-cards">NerdWallet’s site</a> is a little slicker than MagnifyMoney’s,
but it seems to be lacking the critical category of travel.  As such, I tend
to lump my travel estimates in with “dining” while using NerdWallet.  The categories supported by
NerdWallet are:
    <ul>
      <li>gas</li>
      <li>grocery/drug</li>
      <li>dining</li>
      <li>other</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I encourage you to play with both sites using your own spending estimates.
But if you just want to see my top 5 recommendations, here they are (in
alphabetical order).</p>

<h2 id="american-express-blue-cash-preferred">☞ American Express Blue Cash Preferred</h2>

<div class="card">
  <p><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/blue-cash-preferred"><img src="/images/amex_blue_preferred.png" alt="Amex Blue Preferred" /></a></p>
</div>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Rewards</strong></td>
      <td>6% groceries, 3% gas, 1% all other</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Annual Fee</strong></td>
      <td>$75</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Foreign Tx Fee</strong></td>
      <td>2.7%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Signup Bonus</strong></td>
      <td>$150 after $1000 in 3 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You won’t beat 6% back on any category and groceries is a category that many
people already use heavily.  Even if you’re not a big grocery buyer, you could use this
card to buy gift cards (Amazon, Target, Chipotle, etc) at your grocery store and
save that 6% at those other places you shop.  However, this reward category
is capped at $6000/year of purchases ($360 of cash-back).</p>

<p>The biggest downside of this card is the $75 annual fee.  You would need to
spend at least <code>$75/.06 = $1250</code> per year in groceries in order to recover the
annual fee.
And if you’re comparing this card to a card with no annual fee that rewards 2%
for groceries, then you need to spend at least <code>$75/(.06-.02) = $1875</code> per year
($36/week) to match what you would get on the 2% rewards card.</p>

<p>Another possible downside is how Amex defines grocery stores.  If you buy groceries
at a superstore like Target, Costco, Sam’s Club or Walmart, then Amex doesn’t
count those purchases towards the 6% reward.  They only count the “regular”
grocery stores such as Safeway, Albertons, or King Soopers.
So be aware of that before you sign up for this card.</p>

<p>Another downside to this card is the 2.7% foreign transaction fee.  If you travel
out of the country you may want to leave this card at home, especially
since there are fewer places that accept Amex abroad.</p>

<h2 id="barclaycard-arrival-world-mastercard">☞ Barclaycard Arrival World MasterCard</h2>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Rewards</strong></td>
      <td>2x travel, 2x dining, 1x all other</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Annual Fee</strong></td>
      <td>$0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Foreign Tx Fee</strong></td>
      <td>0%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Signup Bonus</strong></td>
      <td>20,000 miles after $1000 in 3 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This card combines good rewards for travel and dining purchases with no annual
fees and no foreign transaction fees.  This makes it a good card to have in your
wallet for eating out both at home and abroad.  And with each point being worth
a penny towards travel redemptions, the $200 signup bonus is icing on the cake.</p>

<p>Also, this card gives you back an additional 5% on redeemed miles.  For example,
if you redeem 10,000 miles, they plop an additional 500 miles back into your account.
Consider if you purchase $100 of travel, you immediately get back 200 miles worth
$2 which is a 2% reward.
And when you eventually redeem those 200 miles you will get 5% of those miles,
or 10 miles, added back to your account.  So effectively you get 210 miles (2.1%)
reward on travel and dining expenses.<br />
It’s not a huge difference over 2%, but it’s something.</p>

<p>One feature not often mentioned for this card is that you can assign a PIN to it.
This is useful for travel in places like Europe where Chip+PIN systems exist.
For example, if you are purchasing train tickets at a kiosk in Europe,
it may not accept a Chip+Signature card but a Chip+PIN card may work just fine.
Chip+PIN systems are more widely accepted in developed countries outside of the
United States so this could be a good backup card to have in your wallet.</p>

<p>The main downside of this card is that your rewards are applied only towards
travel purchases so you will have to wait until you have travel expenses before
you can cash in your rewards.  Fortunately you don’t have to pay for your entire
travel expense with the rewards, so you can use up whatever miles you have to
pay for just a portion of your travel expenses.</p>

<p>If you don’t travel much and prefer cash
rewards, you might want to consider one of the cash-rewards cards first.</p>

<p>This is my favorite rewards card that doesn’t have a foreign transaction fee or
an annual fee.
You still get a very good reward amount without having to pay any fees.
I like the no-nonsense approach of this card.</p>

<p>This is a very good card to keep in your wallet for international travel expenses
and is also a pretty good choice for every-day spending at home.</p>

<h2 id="citi-double-cash">☞ Citi Double Cash</h2>

<div class="card">
  <p><a href="https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card"><img src="/images/citi_double.jpg" alt="Citi Double Cash" /></a></p>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Rewards</strong></td>
      <td>2%</td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Annual Fee</strong></td>
      <td>$0</td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Foreign Tx Fee</strong></td>
      <td>3%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Signup Bonus</strong></td>
      <td>none</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The Citi Double cash reward is fairly unique in that it gives you a 1% reward
at the time of the transaction and another 1% reward when you pay down the balance.
Effectively this is a 2% cash-back reward but you get half of it now and half of
it later.  If you pay your balance every month then “later” is next month.</p>

<p>Combining that with the fact that the card doesn’t have an annual fee makes it a
good choice for your go-to card.</p>

<p>My main gripe with this card is that it has a 3% foreign transaction fee which
means you will want to leave it at home when you travel internationally.  But
for domestic spending it’s a great deal.</p>

<h2 id="fidelity-rewards-visa-signature-card">☞  Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature Card</h2>

<p>The Fidelity rewards card is a great option for people who already have an
account with Fidelity.  The rewards for this card can go directly to your Fidelity
account and be invested so it’s a nice way to do some “free” investing, which is
akin to cashing in your pocket change and investing it.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t have a Fidelity account, you can open one with zero balance
and tie it to this card.</p>

<p>The downsides of this card are the foreign transaction fee and the requirement
to have a Fidelity account.
The 1% foreign transaction fee is not too bad but zero would be better.  And opening
an account at Fidelity is not necessarily a show-stopper but it could be annoying
if you already have your investments with another firm.</p>

<p>Overall this is a solid card and it may be a good choice for you.</p>

<h2 id="the-1st-card-in-my-wallet">The 1st Card in My Wallet</h2>

<div class="card">
  <p><a href="https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/quicksilver/"><img src="/images/capitalone_quicksilver.png" alt="Capital One Quicksilver Cash" /></a></p>
</div>

<p>If I had to carry just 1 card in my wallet, it would need to be a card that is
widely accepted worldwide and still gives a decent reward for everyday expenditures.
Frankly, this eliminates the Amex cards because they just aren’t accepted at as many
places as VISA and MasterCard.</p>

<p>For me, the first card in my wallet is the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards
card.  The no-nonsense approach to rewards (1.5%) and fees (0%) gives it a slight
edge in my book over the cards that give slightly higher rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Runner Up</strong>: My second choice for my 1st card is the Fidelity Rewards Visa
card.  Its high rewards coming with low foreign transaction fee makes it a solid
backup.  I also like the idea that the rewards could contribute directly to
retirement savings.</p>

<h2 id="the-2nd-card-in-my-wallet">The 2nd Card in My Wallet</h2>

<div class="card">
  <p><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/blue-cash-preferred"><img src="/images/amex_blue_preferred.png" alt="Amex Blue Preferred" /></a></p>
</div>

<p>Since the first card in my wallet has no foreign transaction fees, I’m fine having
a card with big rewards that is mostly for domestic use.  My number 2 card is the
American Express Blue Cash Preferred card.  The huge 6% rewards for grocery expenses
is too hard to ignore and easily covers the annual fee for me.<br />
Combining this with the fact that you can buy gift cards
for other merchants like Amazon, Target, Southwest Airlines, or just about any
major restaurant chain, means you can shift some of this reward to those categories
with the judicious use of gift cards.</p>

<p><strong>Runner Up</strong>: My second choice for my 2nd card is the Citi Double Cash card.
The Citi card would be a higher choice if it weren’t for the higher foreign transaction
fees and the reputation of the bank behind it.  But a no-annual fee card with
2% cash rewards is a great backup choice.</p>

<h2 id="the-3rd-card-in-my-wallet">The 3rd Card in My Wallet</h2>

<div class="card">
  <p><a href="http://www.findmybarclaycard.com/barclaycard-credit-cards/arrival-travel"><img src="/images/barclay_arrival.jpg" alt="Barclaycard Arrival World" /></a></p>
</div>

<p>For the 3rd card in my wallet, I would choose the Barclaycard Arrival World
MasterCard.
This card is a good option for traveling abroad with it’s zero foreign
transaction fees and high travel and dining rewards.  I also like the idea of
rounding out my 3 cards with one of each type (VISA, Amex, MasterCard), to make
sure I have maximal card coverage wherever I go.</p>

<p><strong>Runner Up</strong>: My second choice for my 3rd card is, again, the Citi Double Cash card.
While they don’t explicitly say what type of card it is, I think most of the Citi
cards are MasterCards. So if this card is on the MasterCard network, this choice
would keep with the idea of rounding out my 3 cards with one of each type.</p>

<h2 id="parting-thoughts-and-a-little-math">Parting Thoughts and a Little Math</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that, when doing your own analysis of credit card options, you need
to consider the opportunity cost of a new card compared to another card, and not
the absolute benefit.  For example, while a 6% benefit on groceries means
that you will earn $6 for every $100 spent, that’s not the only consideration.
You also need to consider how that reward compares to another card that
maybe has a smaller reward but also a smaller annual fee.</p>

<p>For example, if you are trying to decide if card_1 (higher reward) is better
than card_2 (lower annual fee), the following equation will determine the
spending threshold above which the card_1 with the higher reward is better
than the card with the lower annual fee.</p>

<p><code>spending &gt; (annual_fee_1 - annual_fee_2) / (reward_1 - reward_2)</code></p>

<p>For example, comparing a card (Amex Blue Cash) with a 6% reward and $75 annual fee to
a card (Citi Double Cash) with a 2% reward and a $0 annual fee,</p>

<p><code>spending &gt; ($75-$0) / (.06-.02) = $1875</code></p>

<p>This means that the card with the higher reward will be able to overcome it’s
higher fee after $1875 worth of spending.  So even though $1250 worth of spending
would pay for the annual fee on the Amex card, it may not be worth getting that
card over the Citi card unless you are pretty sure you’ll spend at least $1875
in that reward category.</p>

<p>But fees and rewards are not the only factors you should look at when considering
a new credit card.
Don’t forget to look at ancillary benefits such as insurance, Apple Pay,
consumer protection, fraud protection, and the company that stands behind the card.</p>
