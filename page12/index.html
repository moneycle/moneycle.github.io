            While doing my taxes this year and playing with possible income changes in the tax software, I noticed a curious phenomenon.  Instead of my taxes changing by my marginal tax rate for any change in income, it was changing by almost 10% more than I expected.  After doing a little research, I narrowed down this unexpected increase of my marginal tax rate to the Affordable Care Act insurance premium credits and how these credits are phased out with increased income.

            Vanguard has a fund called the Managed Payout Fund that is "designed to give you regular monthly payouts". The way that this fund calculates the monthly payouts happens to be remarkably similar to the buffered withdrawal strategy discussed in previous articles on this blog.

            Withdrawing money from your portfolio using a fixed percentage can guarantee that you'll never run out of money but it also ties the the volatility of your income the returns of your portfolio. Buffering the withdrawals can reduce that volatility to a more tolerable level.
